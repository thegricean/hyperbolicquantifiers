Questions/things to think about
--------------------

1. How is hyperbolic all different from or similar to all with domain restriction? QUD? Affect?

2. How can we get reliable judgments for hyperbolic uses of all?

3. How can we manipulate and model salience of different domains?

4. Time/events vs objects?

TODO
--------------------

### Experiments

1. Revise experiments to add domain restriction manipulation, such that there may be a salient subset of items

2. Figure out how to systematically vary salience of domain, salience of affect as QUD, and plausibility of literal interpretations

3. Figure out how to measure domain, interpretation, and affect (as well as corresponding priors)

### Corpus

1. Clean up/extract uses of "all" with definite determiners

2. Figure out how to present corpus data for turkers to annotate--tenary choice: hyperbolic, literal, question doesn't make sense

### Model

1. Discuss with Leon: inferring domain and QUD at the same time
