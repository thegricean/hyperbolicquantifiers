Annotation scheme
=====================

# 03/26/2015
Justine and Judith annotated a random sample of 150 cases from the overt/null partitive portion of data/swbdext.tab (1225 cases) for the reading of "all", using the following annotation scheme:
- literal
- literal_dr (literal within a restricted domain)
- hyperbolic
- existential ("there are all of these magazines where you can learn...", nonspecific uses of "all")
- hedge ("almost all")
- other
