26:56	###.###and, uh, we were, i was fortunate in that i was personally acquainted with the, uh, people who, uh, --n400945 ran the nursing home in our little hometown.###.###yeah.###.###so, i was very comfortable, you know, in --n400aee doing it when it got to the point that we had --n400b21 to do it --n400b34 --n400b3b.###but there's,###well, i had an occasion for my mother-in-law who --n400ccc had fell and needed to be, you know, could not take care of herself anymore, was confined --n400d27 to a nursing home for a while###that was really not a very good experience.###uh, it had --n400f46 to be done --n400f59 in a hurry.	###and it was really not, not very good, uh, deal.###.###yeah.
41:71	###we were not really happy with, nursing home that we finally had --n40121a.###.###yeah.###.###fortunately, she only had --n4012e0 to stay a few weeks###and she was able --n40136e to, to return to her apartment again.###but it's really a big, uh, big, uh, decision as to, you know, when to do it --n4014a2.###.###yeah.###.	###of course, you know, there's not one on every corner, especially, you know, smaller areas, smaller towns.###.###yeah.
76:58	###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###because it was, you know, it was just a change of, change of location###and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling.###.###yes.###.	###.###uh-huh###.
119:4	###my mother, excuse me.### go ahead.###.###yeah.###well, my, uh, my, uh,###probably one of the biggest decisions i think that --n402bba was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision than just delegate it.###.###uh-huh.###.###i think that they, they had a great deal of, um,	###and they actually had a conference.###.###that's great.
189:53	###my mother also was very very independent.###she had her own, still had her own little house and still driving her own car, at age eighty-three.###.###yeah.###.###we were lucky in, that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really, you know, really much aware of what --n4043b8 was going on.###.###uh-huh.###.###that nursing home life would not have been, you know, anything of her choosing,	###.###um.###.
325:23	###yes.###.###you know i mean, of course there, there comes other issues, you know, whether or not any of the grandparents whether we feel like are going to be a good, they're going --n406cdf to be a good caretaker for our children.###.###yes,###.###but,###.###just because they're grandparents.###.	###.###yeah.###just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically make them a good child carer.
430:34	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###um, you know, there's real no, no real dress code where i work --n400983.	###i, um, don't like --n400b1a to wear heels,###that really tires me out.###i work in a big building.
441:104	###i, um, don't like --n400b1a to wear heels,###that really tires me out.###i work in a big building.###.###yeah.###.###so, i predominantly wear flat shoes.###um, you know, in the winter i wear sweaters,###in summer i, you know, i like one piece dresses, short sleeves, things like that.###.	###.###right.###.
656:76	###.###terrain.###.###yeah.### is, is fairly famili-,.###the thing that i thought --n400ab0 was interesting was that the critics,###apparently it's going --n400b7d to win everything.###.###really.###.	###.###that's true.###.
664:20	###really.###.###uh, and i had been told --n400c27, you know, you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long, and all this, kind of,###.###that's true.###.###.###i agree with that.###um, i, i noticed yesterday in the paper, something --n400e42 said that it,###i think it's been nominated --n400f42 for twelve awards	###so, it, it has surprised everybody.###.###well, the interesting thing was is i had heard that,
766:37	###or did he just do it.###.### i think that, i think he really,###his heart was in it,###but i, i don't think he really knew it was going --n40371e to be as big as it was.###i think it was something that he really wanted --n40387f to do --n40388e.###he wanted --n40394c to direct it,###he wanted --n4039b6 to, to star in it.###you know, he, he enjoyed the story line###and i think he just really w-, he really wanted it.	###because i think that, i think he did a good job### and, and the self-satisfaction he got --n403e7e out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give --n403eb9 him.###.
811:55	### that's, that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said --n4046d5,###did you notice that.###.###huh-uh.###.###i thought, no,###it's really funny.###but i thought, it, it,###you think back,###and yeah,	###.###yeah.###.
1007:10	### so, or if my call rate of, of eight t-, or so a week went up even higher because, uh, someone had, had,###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###.###they had you pegged --n404986.###.###right.###and the person who --n4049fd had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money	###.###yeah.###.
1099:54	###.###uh-huh.###.###whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much --n407174, if you go out and then act like the lunatic you, you violate the, uh, the norms of social, of, um, public behavior.###um, people start --n4073d8 paying attention to you very much###and they start --n40746c asking questions and in the sense are invite-, invade, invading your privacy although, if you know what the social norms are --n4074df, you know, quote unquote, you asked for it.###but it does mean that you have yet another reason --n4076dd to follow a set of social norms --n407700.###.###yes.###.	###and it wasn't until i was thinking about it just now that i realized that's actually something that --n407931's culturally relative.###.### tha-, that is true.
1170:17	###and invariably just about the time, i'm going --n400645 to sleep --n400654, the phone tears off the wall.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###and you are trying --n400782 to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone,### you either hear, the cli-, as soon as you say hello, you hear the click of the recording coming on,###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###that's true,###or the ones that --n400b78 are, are generated --n400b8f by a computer.
1187:29	###i've even had some of them,### the, they're voice activated###and you've got --n400e9c to say hello twice before they'll do anything.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###yeah,###sometimes i, i get them on my, uh, answering machine at home### so, and i hate that when i've got a whole bunch of messages --n4010c0###and i go through them	###.###what i would love --n401258 to see --n401267 done to stop all of this,###.
1189:45	###and you've got --n400e9c to say hello twice before they'll do anything.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###yeah,###sometimes i, i get them on my, uh, answering machine at home### so, and i hate that when i've got a whole bunch of messages --n4010c0###and i go through them###and most of them aren't from anybody at all.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
1205:16	###.###uh-huh.###.###and i think a law should be passed --n40147b to where any of these people,###i think it --n401557's great, that you know, freedom of speech in this country and everything,###but if they're going --n40168b to offer these services, or these recorded message, everything, they ought --n4016ca to be stuck --n4016dd working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer --n40171c to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them.###.###uh-huh,###yes,###see i have an unlisted telephone number,	###and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand --n401aa7.###so, yeah,###i do,
1255:36	###yeah,###no,### i, i agree with you there.###if they want --n4033b0 to choose that particular religion that's fine with me too, you know, as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in.### and, and i don't like the way that they do it either --n4035a6,### and, and, it --n403670's their mission that they do it.###they go door to door###and they go out into the public###and they actually have the, uh, teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work###and, uh, i don't know,	###and that, that's one thing that i feel really strongly about --n403ace though, is, uh, you know, people --n403afd coming up to my door, and especially religious organizations and wanting --n403b34 to uh, you know, to try and get me to join or, you know, become interested in their religion,###because i have my own.###.
1392:23	###.###yes.###.###okay,###like i said i guess it would be the work force, you know, as far as changes in the generations.###.###yes,###i know because, i know when my mother was a, you know, going into the work force --n400a6f there wasn't very many opportunities for her, i guess,###she's in her late forties.###you were expected --n400c54 to stay home and take care of the kids	###.###uh, no,###i think no-, now, you go to work when they're six weeks old, you know --n400df3,
1566:61	###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah,###you have your career and your home life,###and that would be a nice way, especially if you have young children.###.###oh, it is,###it is,###well both of ours is school age,	###.###uh-huh,###oh, no,
1680:23	###bye-bye.###.###.###hi.###.###hi,###um, okay### what, now, uh, what particularly, particularly what kind of music do you like --n4000c3.###.###well, i mostly listen to popular music.	###so, i, i tend --n400309 to be one of those people who --n40032c switches stations a lot because i don't like commercials.###but, uh, i find myself listening to popular music,###.
1773:51	###.###yeah,###you really.###it seemed --n4023e6 to be influenced --n4023f9 by a lot of different music.###a lot of times you'll hear songs that you know, --n4024ce they're not original, but have been put --n4024f9 to a rap kind of a rhythm.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, sounds, it sounds so much different###and yet, i, i have a much younger sister who --n402728 listens to a lot of rap music	###and yet, she thought they were brand new, original pieces.###.###yeah.
1946:123	###.###uh-huh.###.###i saw some promise, you know, with, with a lot of the new wave, when it, when it came out, uh, back in the mid and early eighties --n406569.###.###yeah.###.###and then, um, i don't know###music is kind of in a weird, it's in a very weird position right now.###i think that,	###and,###.###like paul simon.
2067:41	###.###.###okay,###so, um,###yes### we do keep, uh, well we started out --n400099 keeping a budget about two years, ago,###we have a computer, here at the house,###.###uh-huh.###.	###and then basically since then what i've done --n40045a is, is keep track of it through the checkbook###so that based on whatever we've got --n400597 coming in, the check coming in, then how much i'm spending --n4005d6 each half of the month and then trying --n400601 to also spe-,###because our house payment is once a month,
2085:14	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###a running total.###.###.###yeah.###.	###.###uh, we've, we've, uh, taken how much we have --n400bf7, you know, write down how much we have --n400c26 coming in each month###and then, uh, we've,
2127:55	###.###you don't have --n401e1a to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that.###.###right,###yeah,###because we don't, you know, we don't charge anything that we can't pay --n401f59 off by the end of the month.###.###that's a good choice,### we've been trying, we're trying --n402102 to, uh, do that this year.###we've budgeted the money that we used --n40220a to spend, we were spending --n402229 on a coda account with t i and then money we were also buying stock with --n402274 for that year,	###.###you've got paper under your table.###.
2154:14	###.###.###yeah,###the only thing we have, --n402862 it to pay --n402875 off is our, is a automobile loan and our house payment,###and that's the only thing we ever,###.###that's good to be in that kind of shape.###.###we try --n402ae2 to stay out of debt.###.	###.###huh. oh it's long term.###we just,
2158:73	###and that's the only thing we ever,###.###that's good to be in that kind of shape.###.###we try --n402ae2 to stay out of debt.###.###what are you all trying --n402b72 to do --n402b81 long term.###.###huh. oh it's long term.###we just,	###and you know, we just have our life insurance for right now.###.###uh-huh.
2236:13	###.###okay,###i guess that's most of my, um, financial plans right now.###.###yeah###mine too.###.### is, is there anything you'd like --n4057aa to add --n4057b9.###.###no,	###.###well it --n4058f8's been nice talking to you.###.
2265:43	###um, i get a charge out of, uh, texas highway, which --n400331 is, uh, very colorful,###and, uh, not being a native of texas, but being here eleven years have a tendency to, uh, find out the, uh, about the different areas of the co-, of the, of the state by --n4004d6 reading it.###.###oh.###.###.###right,###i've read that one too.###i only had a subscription once,###but my mother always gave me hers	###.###oh yeah,### it's, it's, uh, absolutely, it's great the way that it's broken out and you can, uh, set up little trips and day trips and things --n400a25.
2322:16	### and, and they give you books### and, and the last book, uh, matter of fact i read --n401f45 was, at america's service by carl albrecht.###it talks about, uh, who the customer is --n40208f and being customer oriented, uh, which --n4020ba falls in line with the t i culture here at texas instruments.###.###yeah.###.###uh, one of its great slogans is if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who --n402297 is.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and as you probably well know, all of us are our own customer.###you're my customer, i'm your customer, sort of thing.###.
2323:25	### and, and the last book, uh, matter of fact i read --n401f45 was, at america's service by carl albrecht.###it talks about, uh, who the customer is --n40208f and being customer oriented, uh, which --n4020ba falls in line with the t i culture here at texas instruments.###.###yeah.###.###uh, one of its great slogans is if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who --n402297 is.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is --n402405	###you're my customer, i'm your customer, sort of thing.###.###right.
2328:217	###uh, one of its great slogans is if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who --n402297 is.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is --n402405###and as you probably well know, all of us are our own customer.###you're my customer, i'm your customer, sort of thing.###.###right.###.	###.###yeah.###.

2409:20	###oh, yeah,###you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other###but, uh, i think sometimes the word is a little over used###.### exactly, exactly right.###.###but,###.###yeah, we, we have, i think we, we name drop it a little too much and, and don't fully understand what, what it is --n404d99 we're saying.###i think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk	###.###yeah.###.
2472:33	###but if we're going --n400f75 to have a meeting, where we're having the attorneys --n400fa8 come in, or people from, uh, other party's attorneys and stuff --n400feb, then i normally dress up.###yeah,###and i'll wear a dress and hose and stuff.###.###yeah,###you know, we're kind of that way too.###i try --n4012d6 to,###i'm the same way you are --n401342,###i kind of try --n4013c3 to judge from day to day.###i know, you know, where i am --n401480 we work a lot with the customers	### and, and, you know, if i know that they're going --n40163e to be there, you know, you, i try --n401671 to really watch it and like you say, you know, really dress up###.###uh-huh.

4095:37	###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###i know.###well i, i, i'm not much of a television watcher.### i, i read as i said, and, uh, quite a bit.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah.###.
4125:31	###uh-huh.###well the last two people who --n4030c0 have called, both worked for t i###and i just wondered.###.###yeah,###yeah,###it could be t i --ers, i think --n403209, probably are participating more than anybody else,###but i needed the money.###this is five bucks here.###.	###.###yeah,###really.
4348:42	###.###yeah.###.###.###and, it's got,###and i've always enjoyed dance.###.###yeah.###.###so it involves, you know,	###and,###.###yeah,
4380:7	###uh-huh.###.###and, someone else is telling me, okay, you know, let's move this way, let's move that way, instead of me having --n40276f to think about it so much.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###you can just trust someone else to give you full exercise	###.###yeah,###yeah.
4431:71	###.###i'm sorry.###.###.###well, i'm in texas.### i, i just assumed that i had,###this is the first call i've done --n40363f,###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###.###you wouldn't know that.
4447:8	###so, it's the, it's, it's the, the act-, well it's actually,###it's interesting, because there are re-, real regional differences.###um, in california there's, uh, almost an assumption, um, unless you're, sort of, clearly of an older generation --n403b8b, or something, you know, in your sixties, or something like that,###.###.### i'm, i'm, i'm not.###uh, there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness, and, and, at least in urban california.###and, maybe not,###i don't know about rural california too well.###but, in urban california it's just, you know,	###i don't know where they actually started --n404162,###but they, you know, the craze really picked up big here###and before that there was the running craze.
4461:34	###and, they,###california gets, you know, tends --n404354 to be a bit faddish,###but, the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere --n40444c.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, there must be something to some of them.###and, uh,###.###well, i think people are, are more inc-, um, um,	###and, i mean, it just, seems like, uh, a lot of those ideas generate out of california.###.###uh-huh.
4488:30	###i think. there, there is a sense of, you know, whole,###there's a lot of, you know,###you'll get organizations, like institutes for the whole health, or whatever.###and, uh, oh the, the, the uni-, university of california at berkeley puts out the wellness letter. which --n404f25 is, uh, turned into a fairly well subscribed to, uh, newsletter, monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that###.###uh-huh.###.### and, and, it doesn't deal with just exercise, or just stress management, or just diet, or anything.### it, it's on fairly so-, solid scientific ground.###uh, it's just dispensed --n405384 with these distinctions.	### and, uh, so it's had that orientation for quite some time.###um, there's been some progressive medical schools --n40572e out here, that --n405745 have taken that approach.###.
4488:129	###i think. there, there is a sense of, you know, whole,###there's a lot of, you know,###you'll get organizations, like institutes for the whole health, or whatever.###and, uh, oh the, the, the uni-, university of california at berkeley puts out the wellness letter. which --n404f25 is, uh, turned into a fairly well subscribed to, uh, newsletter, monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that###.###uh-huh.###.### and, and, it doesn't deal with just exercise, or just stress management, or just diet, or anything.### it, it's on fairly so-, solid scientific ground.###uh, it's just dispensed --n405384 with these distinctions.	### and, uh, so it's had that orientation for quite some time.###um, there's been some progressive medical schools --n40572e out here, that --n405745 have taken that approach.###.
4545:25	###and more and more people start --n406aaa believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things --n406ae1,###.###uh-huh.###.###and, before long, you, you get this, this whole kind of gestalt, this whole package of, of health, of health care and options###.###uh-huh.###.### and, uh, and exercise is, is strongly considered --n406e13 one of them.###the irony is, is it's people in the cities, in my experience, that --n406f38 are most oriented towards --n406f4f doing the exercise.	###the average person out on the farm, at least traditionally, now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally, the laborers,###.###yeah.
4581:29	###.###.###yeah,###well i, i think so.###.###as a fit person.###.###i mean you, you've,### if you look at cert-, if you look at other cultures,###like i know a little bit about people who --n407dc1 were considered --n407dd0 very healthy in china	###but, they do a lot of low keyed, low impact, low stress exercise,###and they combine it with a, you know, meditation or whatever. some sort of relaxation###.
4665:42	###well of course in the cities,###.###.###yeah,###well, in the cities,###we live close to dallas,###.###uh-huh.###.###so, uh, which, you know,	###so, you're going --n40964d to have a lot of di-, more choices,###.###uh-huh,
4729:48	###.###you know where saint joe is --n4004e5.###.###uh, i've been through there.###.###i'm about eight miles south of it.###.###okay.###oh, yeah.###i had been through saint joe,	###.###well, you know, i've, i've seen those statistics and everything,###and you know, what --n400952 frightens me, is that, you put a half a million people --n40098d out in the middle of the desert with high tech weaponry, you know,
4737:30	###oh, yeah.###i had been through saint joe,###but, um, just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that, it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad.###.###well, you know, i've, i've seen those statistics and everything,###and you know, what --n400952 frightens me, is that, you put a half a million people --n40098d out in the middle of the desert with high tech weaponry, you know,###.###huh-uh.###.###i mean, the iraqis didn't have a lot of high-tech weaponry,	###.###oh, yeah.###.
4913:12	###because that's what our society becomes --n4041b6.### we have, we have just a bunch of people,###.###comes,###yeah.###.### and i've, and i've, i've lived in that, that environment for quite a few years when i was doing construction work --n40438c.###you know, and these guys, they come to work every morning###and they're stoned to the bone.###i mean, they're so high, they could fly up to the top of that building	###and they go home###and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs###and when they run out of money --n404824, they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money,
4944:33	###.###and these kids were more foulmouthed than i've ever been.###i had one kid threaten my life, threaten my life.###.###in the first grade.###.### told me that daddy's going --n404e1e to whoop me to death.###.###oh, know.###.	###.###huh-uh.###.
5081:26	###or is this mainly cross-stitching.###.###um, i do mostly that, um,###not very artistic --n400e0c really for like painting and stuff.###.###oh, uh-huh.###um, yeah.###.###but, now i don't know.###.	###.###oh, really.###yeah,

5128:13	###.###good grief.###yeah,###there's lots of pinks and greens.###.###pinks and greens.###yeah.###.###there's lots of shades of greens.###but the colors,	###.###yeah.###.
5341:8	###i guess, i just wanted more news.###it's one of the few times i wanted more news than.###.###yeah,###well, i know even if you watched a b c, n b c or the other,###i mean, what's the other one --n400a32, uh,###c b s.###.###c b s.###.	###.###were they.###.
5354:6	###.###uh-uh.###.###yeah.###.###that's the only thing they broadcast --n400c40###and like you i listened to radio on my job at work.###.###uh-huh.###.	###well, i listen to a christian radio station.###.###uh-huh.
5372:12	###you can't really be sure of the quality of what you've got --n4010f8, you know.###.###huh.###.###uh, we had some, uh, some people from our church --n401218 went to israel, uh, just for a, uh, tour sort of thing.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i was watching on tv### they, they broadcast this terrible riot --n401410 supposedly that --n40141f was going on in jerusalem,	### come --n40156f to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of it,###.###right.
5395:12	###.###right,###right.###.###but, uh, i, i'm from california###and i can remember --n401bba being in, uh, in these earthquakes###and, i mean they were, they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view, and it seemed --n401ccd, you know, from anyone else's point of view,###.###yeah.###.	###.###uh-huh.###well i, i find it --n401f61 depressing --n401f6c to watch our,
5523:9	###well i, i got into a conversation last night with a lady###and they interrupt at ten, minutes.###.###i see.###.###so if we've done our three minutes. let's just let the conversation end and say bye.###.###uh-huh.###.###.	###nice talking to you.###.###nice talking to you too.
5645:17	###.###and,###.###oh.###raleigh durham.###yeah.###.###yeah.###that area.###and it's really small.	###.###uh-huh.###.
5863:16	###but nobody can get one more point --n4050d0 to become, you know, like whatever you need --n4050ff --n405106 to earn so much money.###.###yeah.###since i imagine it's fairly competitive.###.###yeah.###it's like,###no### i, i mean, i b m is like,###there's a joke about i b m which --n4053e7 says, you know, it's like, uh,	###right.###.###uh-huh.
5927:7	###uh-huh.###.###and then the other people just plan it, you know.### it's like, it's like have you, have have you ever seen the commercial like for federal express where the, with, uh, the think tank. you know,###.###mumblex push paper around.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###has anybody thought of anything.###.###.
6058:78	###.### they, they made like, uh, small personal computers.###.###yeah.###small p c --s.###mumblex they're out of korea###right.###.###i don't know.###i don't know.	###.###uh-huh.###.
6058:133	###.### they, they made like, uh, small personal computers.###.###yeah.###small p c --s.###mumblex they're out of korea###right.###.###i don't know.###i don't know.	###.###uh-huh.###.
6083:23	###.###okay.###.###and so that's,###i mean, they're still around i think --n409661.###.###yeah.### i've seen, well i've seen them around anyway. you know mumblex.###.###so, that's what they do --n40981d.	### and they mumblex, and that's why they're so compatible --n409989. because i mean###.###uh-huh.
6104:47	###in a way you realize,###i mean, one t-, one of my teachers got this computer which, you know,###it's like, uh, voice, uh, synthesizing stuff.###.###uh-huh.###.###and he got that.###he said, you know, it's like, uh,###i was testing it###and it was wonderful.	###.###wow.###.
6104:76	###in a way you realize,###i mean, one t-, one of my teachers got this computer which, you know,###it's like, uh, voice, uh, synthesizing stuff.###.###uh-huh.###.###and he got that.###he said, you know, it's like, uh,###i was testing it###and it was wonderful.	###.###wow.###.
6225:123	###when i was much younger --n400e44 it --n400e4f was, uh, less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits.###but as i grow older and my family grows, it, the medical benefits are more important###and the retirement is more important.###.###i had never really thought of it that way###but i guess that's true,###i guess that's true.###i'm still young enough that, that, uh, the vacation's real important to me###and the paid time off --n401362 is real important to me and, and that kind of thing.###but, uh, you know, i was just, as a matter of fact, i just, uh, celebrated my fifth year at t i the end of last month and, uh, kind of started --n401507 looking through the, the book because of that, you know,	###and, you know, when you're, when you're, you know, in your,###i'm only in my late twenties now,###so you tend --n401b06 not to think about retirement.
6255:5	###.###and i suppose if, b-, maybe in, in your instance, if, if you're started --n402204 with t i in your early to mid-twenties, and happen --n402237 to stay with them until you're sixty-five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan.###.###right.###.###but i had another career first and then came to t i a little later.###.###uh-huh.###.###so it's not, uh,	###.###it's not going --n4026c9 to build up, quite enough,###.
6310:88	###.###uh, it's shown a history that, uh, --n4035d6 sure beats anything else. over many, many years.###.###yeah,###that's true.###that's very true.###.###.###we went, uh, and did a, a thing through i b s which --n4037a7 is a, like a financial consultant type thing here in dallas###and, uh, one of the things that we talked about --n403937 with the counselor there was, you know,	###and then one of the things that we talked about --n403ce6 with her was, you know, the need to save for our son's education.###we have a two year old, you know,### and, and, you know, we can't start --n403ee8 saving for college when he's sixteen --n403f0b, you know,
6342:5	### that's, what, that's exactly what --n404d05's happening in my family.###.###yeah,###.###.###is it really.###yeah.###.### un-, except that mine are a little bit older### and, and i've shown them the numbers and said this is what --n404f2b's going --n404f3a to be available,	###.###uh-huh.###.
6353:22	###.###uh-huh.###.###you better make sure that you've got a scholarship.###.###that's right.###.###.###that's right.###well, that's what she said --n4052d2 to us.	### and, and our answer was, that, you know, we will have enough money --n4054c6 available for him to attend a state college.###and if he wants --n4055fd to go to a private college, he can get a scholarship to attend, you know.###and that was kind of our view on it.
6398:23	###and i said, that's great.### let me explain to you how you get scholarships, to do that --n40634a.###.###that's right,###.###.###that's right.###well, you know, t i, you know, t i offers some good stuff###and then i think there's, i mean i think there's some negatives,###but there's going --n40669f to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go --n4066de.	###this is the first really large company i've worked for --n406854.###i've always been involved in little small, you know, ind-, privately owned s-, owned firms###and so i've never had the, the big benefit package.
6439:18	###.###right.###.###.###that sounds really good.###i read a thing,###i don't even remember if it was in the dallasite --n4076a8 or the insite --n4076bb one, about uh, companies allowing you,###and they said that t i was looking into it, to purchase extra vacation days. which i thought --n40782f sounded like a good idea.###you know, if you've been there, you know, under five years and you get two weeks of vacation but that's really not enough and you want an extra week, then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by --n407a07 saying, okay, i'm going --n407a2a to want an extra five days this year###and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck, you know,	###so you, you can have an extra five days off and be paid --n407dd9 for them at the time, you know,###you're really not being paid --n407f03 for them,###the money is actually coming out of your own pocket,
6443:41	###that sounds really good.###i read a thing,###i don't even remember if it was in the dallasite --n4076a8 or the insite --n4076bb one, about uh, companies allowing you,###and they said that t i was looking into it, to purchase extra vacation days. which i thought --n40782f sounded like a good idea.###you know, if you've been there, you know, under five years and you get two weeks of vacation but that's really not enough and you want an extra week, then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by --n407a07 saying, okay, i'm going --n407a2a to want an extra five days this year###and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck, you know,###and they're deducting it all along,###so you, you can have an extra five days off and be paid --n407dd9 for them at the time, you know,###you're really not being paid --n407f03 for them,###the money is actually coming out of your own pocket,	###so, that is kind of an idea that, that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in --n40814d###and t i said that they were looking into something like that###so,
6516:38	###.###i think it would be a great idea.###i'm not sure about requiring it, you know, of people, because people are going, you know, feeling resentful.###i don't know,###but i think it would be a great idea.###.###yeah.###.### seems like there's so many kids that --n4004b4 don't have any since of, you know, what they want --n4004ef to be --n4004fe or do --n40050d###or, you know, they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time	###so,###.###huh-uh.
6558:50	###huh-uh.###.### and, but, i don't know.###if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that --n4013f5 are so poor that they wouldn't be able --n401420 to really, you know, send children to do that.###.###yeah.###.###i didn't know.###.### i don't, i don't know how the peace corps works --n40167f,	###.###yeah,###i was too.
6591:122	###but i guess, they, you could put some money --n401dc0 aside while you were there, your expenses and,###.###wasn't jimmy carter's mama that --n401ef7 was in the peace corps.###.###yeah,###i think so,###yeah,###yeah.###.###.	###.###where they couldn't do that --n4023d1.###yeah,
6682:18	###and he was, uh, a rock rib iowa type republican###and the only good thing he could ever say --n403fb3 about, uh, the whole roosevelt administration was, uh, civilian conservation corps,###.###huh-uh.###.###because he was in it.###he thought that was great.###.###yeah.###.	###but that was great.###.###well, it seems like it would develop pride, you know, in people, if, if, it's in their own country.
6689:73	###.###yeah.###.###the rest of it was all hog wash,###but that was great.###.###well, it seems like it would develop pride, you know, in people, if, if, it's in their own country.###it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have --n404402 here and develop some pride in them, if it was handled --n404439 that way.### i, i,###it would take quite a few people.	###so maybe that part of it would be helpful too.###.###yeah.
6724:13	###.###huh-uh.###.###and, uh, when the politics get real confusing --n405040,###.###yeah,###really there could be, um, some scandals involved, if, you know, it wasn't people that --n405121 were really fair and le-, you know, in a legal way or something,###.###yeah.###.	###or,###.###yeah.
6783:57	###but you know, i'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that --n406732 really do have good hearts and are willing --n406759 to help and serve and that kind of thing.### i just, i saw on the news the other night that the, uh, the little girl that --n406940 used --n40694b to be the littlest girl on the cosby show, kisha knight pullman, was starting a,###i guess now she's practically a teenager,###.###yeah.###.###she started some type of, um, national organization for youth to volunteer --n406c01 to teach, tutor other kids to read and, you know, do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards, you know, helpful things,###and i know everyone like in the high schools in dallas,###there's a couple high schools that --n406f23 have wanted --n406f32 to start like a, um, minority, you know,###i think it was in a hispanic area,	###.###huh-uh.###.
6819:87	###.### like, like i said at the beginning i've got so many connections with people in central america.###my daughter-in-law is panamanian, you know,###.###huh-uh.###.###and they have situations like, like that down there. where they, they have, these, the social, in some sort of way --n407cdc,###.###huh-uh.###.	###.###huh-uh.###.
6829:14	###if you want --n407e61 to go to school outside the country, and many salvadorians did, they'd go to school in cornell, iowa, of all places,###.###huh-uh.###.###and when they came back --n408013, they'd have --n40802a to serve this, this year,###and it turned out --n408120 to be kind of a joke,###the ones i knew --n4081bd, you know, always chose the red cross, because they didn't do anything###.###oh, i see.###.	###.###yeah.###.
6848:19	###and so,###.###well, we, um, belong to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints, which --n4087e4 is like mumblex the mormon church.###.###huh-uh.###huh-uh.###.###and, um, there, there is men and also women,###women aren't nearly as frequent,###and also that --n408a29 have elderly couples --n408a3c once their kids have left, that --n408a5f can volunteer --n408a6e to go on a mission	###and, it's incredible logistics,###i mean, they have a training center where they teach them --n408c6f,###it's called --n408d16 the missionary training center in utah,
6852:43	###huh-uh.###huh-uh.###.###and, um, there, there is men and also women,###women aren't nearly as frequent,###and also that --n408a29 have elderly couples --n408a3c once their kids have left, that --n408a5f can volunteer --n408a6e to go on a mission###and, um, they're all over the world.###and, it's incredible logistics,###i mean, they have a training center where they teach them --n408c6f,###it's called --n408d16 the missionary training center in utah,	###.###yeah.###.
6963:10	###.###.###that's what i do --n40114c.###.###right.###.###that's what i do --n4011d6.###just a second.###sorry.###.	### sounds like you have a little one there.###.###i have two little ones.
7143:140	###bye-bye.###.###bye-bye.###.###.###all righty.###uh, i'll just hand it off to you###and hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected --n4000eb to discuss --n4000fa today.###.###well, uh, the hobbies that i pursue --n4001db in my spare time, are crafts	###.###oh.###.
7309:15	###i love --n403037 to cook, too,###i'm, uh,###.###italian food.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah,###pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff.###.	###so, i,###it,###.

8279:21	###not very much,###no.###.###no.###.###i don't have the patience --n408fcf to read.###.###see i do that --n40904c to make myself go to sleep at night.###.###yeah.	###.###you saw field of dreams, right, a long time ago.###.
8365:35	###how about in your case.###.###well, in my case my husband is not a carpenter,###but, in fact, he's in electronics,###but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home --n400f2a is if he would build it.###so it took him about two and a half years,###but, uh, he built us a house,###it's, uh,###we have thirty-two hundred square feet,###and it's a brick house,	###so that way he could, we could kind of control, in, control it,###.###uh-huh.
8378:11	###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, we live in kind of a small town,###.###uh-huh.###.###and i mean it's nothing fancy, you know,### it's, it's a house,###it's nice,###and it's real pretty	###.###well, that's great,###that's great,
8438:51	###well,###.###.###first one is always a bear.###.###yes,###yes.###.###we're having a, an architect friend of mine design a house for us###and that can basically be, be put on any lot, in any state, any kin-, you know,	###.###oh.###.
8477:32	###but, uh, like i said otherwise, you know, a-, the expense,###but, you know, we could not have one as large as we have if, you know, we hadn't did it ourselves.###.###sure,###i can imagine.###.###yeah,###i mean it's not an eldorado house or anything like that,###but, you know, it's ours.###.	###.###that's right.###that's right.
8482:10	###.###yeah,###i mean it's not an eldorado house or anything like that,###but, you know, it's ours.###.###if you're happy with it, that's all that --n40393c counts.###.###that's right.###that's right.###.	### on-, you only have --n403aa3 to, uh, satisfy yourself and no one else.###.### ap-, apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high.
8554:6	###.###okay.###.###because, um, they don't allow me to work since, uh, i'm a foreign student.###.###oh, okay.###.###and so they, the government doesn't allow me to work.###.###yeah,	###.###uh-huh.###.
8566:25	###uh-huh.###.###so, you got --n401841 to make, uh,###so how do you keep track of where you are --n4018dc in, in your monthly spending --n4018fb.###.###well, the thing is, is that, um, i ba-, i basically know how much i have --n401a32, right.###.###right.###.###and so, the thing is, is that i, i can tell like, uh,	###.###yeah.###.
8669:56	###um, computer communications and data transmissions.###.###oh, okay,###so you want --n40350f to find a, uh, data transmissions,###you're looking for, uh, um, long distance type stuff.###.###right.###.###.###yeah,	###and so, well, you have a family, right.###.###yeah,
8716:71	###right.###.###and we know what bills --n40424d have --n404258 to be paid --n40426b,###and, uh, we pay as many of those bills that --n404327 can be paid --n40433a with, with the monthly budget,###so.###.###so, you don't have any problem in, um, overcharging on your credit card, and stuff like that.###.###oh sure.###we're like everybody else, you know,	###.###yeah,###yeah.
8725:78	###we're like everybody else, you know,###we've got a, several credit cards that sometimes, um, instead of --n404672 paying --n40467d them all off every month maybe you have --n4046a4 to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around christmas time.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###you know, that's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff --n404957.###.###well then, uh, see, uh, that's, that's one of the points which i don't see --n404a63,###like i, i don't give a lot of gifts during christmas	###.###yeah.###.
8766:12	###.###right,###but###.###necessary things, no frivolous gifts.###.###right,###but, um, the thing is, especially remember when i was down in argentina --n405771### it was, to me it was ridiculous, because you know, you have --n405853 to,###once a year you go out	###and some you don't care about --n405a25, you know,###it's like,###.
8766:22	###.###right,###but###.###necessary things, no frivolous gifts.###.###right,###but, um, the thing is, especially remember when i was down in argentina --n405771### it was, to me it was ridiculous, because you know, you have --n405853 to,###once a year you go out	###and some you don't care about --n405a25, you know,###it's like,###.
8957:61	###.###mile a minute.###that's the name of it.###.###mile a minute.###.###mile a minute.###.###well, i'm not sure what she does --n40295a### i, i,	###i guess that is your standard knitting, isn't it.###.###yeah,
8981:16	###.###and my husband says that's called --n4030c5 rinky-dink.###.###instead of call waiting or call anything else.###.###no,###no.###.###.###we can't have that down here.	###.###well, i guess that's, that's one way to end a conversation --n4032e7.###.
8987:16	###no.###.###.###we can't have that down here.###we get disconnected --n403242 all the time.###.###well, i guess that's, that's one way to end a conversation --n4032e7.###.###yeah,###well, it gets a little aggravating.	### and, and, you know, sometimes they get disconnected --n4034f3 when i'm talking to them --n403512.###.###yeah.
9009:154	###uh, what else did i get --n403779 in there,###and jalapeno peppers.###.###oh, yeah,### always got --n403863 to have those.###.###yeah.###.###i think i had four, uh, jalapeno plants last year.###i think one of them died,	###nobody else in the family likes them,###but always got --n403d64 to the keep those planted.###.
9029:15	###besides they're fun to grow --n403fd6.###.###i planted, uh, zucchini last year.###uh, i planted four hills of them.###i think i had three or four seeds in each one of them,###and those things just flat took over.###um, it wasn't until late, i guess in the summer,###maybe it was because it was too dry,###they finally started --n404387 making zucchini,###and i'm not sure when a good time to plant those --n40441d is --n404428, if they should be planted --n404447 early or later.	###.###supposedly after the soil warms up.###.
9034:33	###and those things just flat took over.###um, it wasn't until late, i guess in the summer,###maybe it was because it was too dry,###they finally started --n404387 making zucchini,###and i'm not sure when a good time to plant those --n40441d is --n404428, if they should be planted --n404447 early or later.###it seems like all i got --n404576 was,###.###supposedly after the soil warms up.###.###i would think so, um,	###and it wasn't until late in the summer they started --n404811 making fruit --n404820.###so, i don't know if i,###mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon. you know,
9078:9	###.###i'm sorry,### go ahead.###.###well, i was just going --n405284 to say, it's a little over six or seven minutes.###so whenever you feel comfortable about concluding --n405394, well, i'm,###that would be fine.###.###oh, just any time.###.	###i guess we'll call this one quits### an, and thanks for participating.###.
9099:32	###bye.###.###bye.###.###.###uh, robert what do you, uh, think, what substances do you think --n400056 are the most, uh, likely causes of air pollution.###.###um, gee,###i don't##, i mean, i, i guess it's the stuff that --n400232 comes out of automobile exhaust, you know,	###.###right.###.
9177:68	###yeah.###.###i mean that's such a spectacle.###it --n401f17 would be a shame to ruin it.###.###yeah.###.###uh, what do you think individuals could do --n401ff3, or society could do --n40200e to alleviate this problem.###.###uh, i don't, uh, i don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals.	###um,###.###right.
9204:4	###and i do think that we have a responsibility there.###i must admit i'm not always real politically active###but i do think that, um, congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards.###.###yeah.###.###and it's brought the,###they, uh, really listen to### the, the, uh, lobbyist and, uh, the car manufacturing companies have, uh, you know, have really pushed,###they,	### we can't, we can't quite make that go###and they don't###and then we still live with air pollution.
9400:58	###but it doesn't really matter.###i mean, i'd, i would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly###but, uh,###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###i have, you know,### i, i, don-,###i think it's really been delightful.### i come, uh, i've spent most of my time in, in warm weather areas	###.###well i spent three years in germany,###so i'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway.
9437:56	###it must be quite a bit hotter down there, isn't it.###.###yeah,###my wife and i, the last day we were in florida, we, my --n40240d visiting my, uh, my parents, and my brother and sister --n40244c,### we were, we were down there###and, the last day, right before we left, we had to, i had --n402668 to ride with my sister###and the air conditioning --n402780 went out on the car,###.###oh, wow.###.	###.###oh yes.###.
9489:73	###i know i, i tend to, i tend --n403432 to be able --n403449 to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate --n403484.###.###speakera50-1*t50-1.###yeah.###speakerbnan*t50-1.###speakerb50-2*t50-2.###uh it doesn't,###some people say, uh, they, they like --n40369a to watch the changing of the seasons###speakeranan*t50-2.###.	###.###yeah.###.
9535:16	###so it's just like well that was my fault.###but then the weather's like,###man, i mean, it gets pretty mundane,###speakerbnan*t57-2.###speakera58-1*t58-1.###i mean you can only talk about, about the situation just so long.###speakerbnan*t58-1.###speakerb58-2*t58-2.###yeah,###i know,	###okay,###speakeranan*t58-2.###.
9550:19	###.###okay.###.###bye-bye.###.###.###bye.###.###.###okay,	###and i would mumblex it like that,### i, i like the adventure of it. and the idea that, that we would survive long enough --n40018e to get to that point and be able --n4001b5 to do these fantastic things in space.###.
9561:40	###and i would mumblex it like that,### i, i like the adventure of it. and the idea that, that we would survive long enough --n40018e to get to that point and be able --n4001b5 to do these fantastic things in space.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and then i like the,###they have a new one now.	###.###right.###.
9580:103	###.###uh-huh.###.###and then i've seen some of the star trek movies.###.###yeah,###those,###the movies are good too.###.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
9590:7	###and i, i guess all, most of the shows i like --n400ae2 are, are kind of along the same line because they're all adventure.###.###uh-huh.###.### when i, when i started --n400cb0 thinking about this --n400cc3, that those are some of my favorite shows,###mcgyver, because it's, it's only one person there, more than, uh, you know, instead of a cast of people,###.###uh-huh.###.###but he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap, and grabbing what he can --n40101e and, you know, pieces of baling wire and, and a few tires	###and,###.###i don't think i, i've even heard of that show.
9612:28	###.###he's like a semigovernment type agent. who --n40149f goes out then to, uh, works for the phoenix foundation, supposedly.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, h-, his big thing is that he can take pieces of, little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things.###he took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###oh, great.###boeing ought --n401992 to hire him and give him a junkyard, and see if he could build a seven forty-seven out of it.
9694:12	###but sesame street is still really good.###.###yeah.###how about mister rogers,###is he still around.###.###yes.###yeah.###they still show mister rogers.###i don't think he's making new ones,	###.###i see.###i see.
9756:19	###but they turned out okay,###so.###.###uh, it didn't hurt them any.###.###yeah.###.###some shows are good for,###i think some shows, some,###star trek, i,	###the idea, i, i think that's one of the things --n4046ef i like --n404702 about star trek.###.###uh-huh.
9860:24	###i see.###.### my folks didn't, my folks,###i'm not even sure if we had one when i was really little --n40629c.###that may be why, bu-,###they probably didn't have a t v until i got --n4063ce to be, you know, grade school or so.###.###yeah.###.###and the shows that i like --n4064fc now, they wouldn't let me watch --n406523.	###like star trek,###they thought that was much too violent for small children.###so,
9905:100	###i'm in nor-,###.###where are you from --n407181.###.###i'm in raleigh, north carolina.###.###oh, my goodness.###i didn't know they did it long distance.###.###yeah,	###.###yes.###.

10081:49	###he really is.###.###he really is an, you know,###as far as predictions and stuff, i really think the rangers may come out real strong this year.###.###they could do very well,###they sure could.###.###they coul-, because###i don't know	###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh,
10091:7	###but last year i just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything,###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh,###right.###.###i really do.###.###yeah,###they've got, uh, i guess all,	###some of them are not too happy about it###but there, there's no hold outs.###.

10382:14	###the cat or the baby.###.###the cat was here first###so. i know,###it's hard.###.### and, and then when we go to sleep --n4010f0 at night, you know, it's like my husband and i have --n40112f to try --n40113e to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us.###.###oh, how funny.###.	###.###that's sweet,###i have the two,
10411:20	###.###oh no.###.###i think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony --n401b42.###.###yes,###uh-huh,###that's it.###.###and lord knows what --n401c6d happened to him.	###.###right,###traumatized for life here.

10467:15	###.###oh yes,###absolutely nuts.###but, uh, luckily enough, you know, we found the cat in time and, uh, rushed him to the vet###and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery###and, tod-,###.###oh lord.###.###i mean he started off as a stray	###.###oh man.###.
10550:69	###and, uh, actually it was on a sign at taco bell drive-thru that --n4045a3 said free kittens.###.###oh uh-huh.###.###and i thought well that's interesting,###i'll call them.###.###right.###.###and he was the only one left	###.###oh, uh-huh.###.

10778:17	###uh-huh.###.###there was cartoon in cosmo about a year or two ago###and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date###and there were cats hanging all over him. hanging on his clothes, you know,###they had ripped him up###and the couch was ripped --n408087 up and down at the bottom###he said, of course i love cats.###.###.	###it was so funny.###.###oh yeah,
10843:260	###um, the, uh, the latest one i've seen --n4000a0, uh, had --n4000b7 to do with a, uh, uh, the, uh, basically a manhunt, um,###and it was, uh, it was called --n4002bd manhunter, actually.###uh, the, uh, the guy, uh, apparently had a, a, mental disfunction in which he needed --n4003e1 to go out and just slay people. uh, just, uh, kill them with, with as much blood and, and guts as possible --n400464.###.###oh, how awful.###.### it was true, it was truly awful.###it was not one that i picked --n400778,###but, uh, uh, it, it did show some, some, uh, some interesting things about the f b i###because they were the, the, uh, the characters trying, trying --n4009c2 to get him were f b i people	###and it was, uh, uh, it was pretty telling about the, the, the f b i and their procedures.###.###i wonder how truthful all of that was --n4011d3 or whether there was fiction.
10846:19	###.###oh, how awful.###.### it was true, it was truly awful.###it was not one that i picked --n400778,###but, uh, uh, it, it did show some, some, uh, some interesting things about the f b i###because they were the, the, uh, the characters trying, trying --n4009c2 to get him were f b i people###and, uh, uh, of the, of the few good things that --n400b76 were in it, it did show, uh, a lot about the f b i. about the training, and, and how they go through training --n400c01 and how they try --n400c18 to, to develop, uh, uh, a mental picture of who they're looking for --n400c67 before they go out and do it --n400c8a and all the different ways they go about --n400cb5 doing that --n400cc4.###and it was, uh, uh, it was pretty telling about the, the, the f b i and their procedures.###.	###.###yeah,### i, i imagine a lot of it had --n4012d3 to be fictional just to keep the f b i, uh, going, i guess.
10881:10	###and i need --n401907 to go --n401916 see it.###.###oh, you need --n40199f to see that.###.###yeah.###.###that is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people. two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was jewish and one was black###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###oh my.###.
10925:112	###.###.###yeah,### i, i think it was more --n40237c a lesson for tom cruise --n402397 than anything else in terms of, uh, of how to act --n4023d6 from dustin hoffman,###but, uh.###.###yes,###uh, oh, that was, that was, uh, what the, much of the hype was --n402615 that tom cruise learned so much from dustin hoffman.###.###yeah,	###.###yeah###and a good bit of that was filmed --n4029d4 right in cincinnati. which --n4029ef is just forty-five miles from, from where i am --n402a2a, where i actually live in a suburb of dayton --n402a59.
10952:143	###.###yes.###.###he had --n402ed1 to buy his underwear at kmart.###.###right,###right###yeah.###.###that was hilarious.	###.###oh yes.###.
11120:46	###but, as far as, uh, trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing --n4003ae, they're testing that.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, they're really not full, full force into it,###but they're trying,###so we're attempting it,###but i wish we could do more.###.###yeah,	###i used --n40079a to work for the power company here###and there was discussion --n400833 for a while about, uh, building a garbage burning, uh, electric generation plant###.
11151:21	###but, uh, they make it as hard as possible,###it's not very convenient to do --n400dfa.###.###right,###when they put centers and stuff like that.###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah,###well we have those --n400f57, uh, which i think --n400f7a is one of the best things is those --n400fa1 cash for cans.	###.###yes.###.
11182:23	###.###.###yeah.###.###so, i really, i really like that,###but, people are really concerned,###it's just that sometimes it's not the right people, which --n401a99 is really, really sad because, i wish we would do more.###.###yeah.###.	###they're really trying,###i think what --n401ceb started it at work was that planet earth thing we had --n401d22 last year.###.
11192:27	###at work we started, uh, all the recycling stuff.###they're really trying,###i think what --n401ceb started it at work was that planet earth thing we had --n401d22 last year.###.###yes.###.###and, uh, that really, started a lot of stuff off,###but, you know sometimes it dwindles down.###.###yeah,	###.###that's good.###.
11241:64	###i know a lot of companies that --n40296f waste so much that,###i'm even trying,###you know that was one thing we noticed --n402a90 last week that we had some new people move into our building and, you know, the nice cardboard boxes that you move, packing boxes. and they were just used --n402b1b one time and thrown --n402b32 in the dumpster###.###yes.###.###and i thought, i don't understand this, you know.###.###yeah.###.	### and, and here we are --n402f2d --n402f34 wasting.###and i don't understand, sometimes, the way, the thinking, the logic behind it.###.
11344:69	###and they look just as good.###that's a smart idea.###.###uh-huh,###yeah.###.###i think i'll have --n404c22 to try that.###that's really cute.###.###yeah	###.###they're the exact same thing.###that's all they are --n404f17,
11347:11	###uh-huh,###yeah.###.###i think i'll have --n404c22 to try that.###that's really cute.###.###yeah###well, you know, it's cheaper than going and buying the kind at target that --n404d4a are all ready with the little design on them or whatever.###.###they're the exact same thing.	###they just made them look fancy.###.###uh-huh,
11362:11	###.###you saved me some money.###.###.###and you're recycling.###.###yes,###yeah.###.###well that's neat.	###we have places that, uh, --n4051a3 pay for paper to recycle --n4051c6,###i know you do yours at work,###but for newspaper.
11373:54	###we have places that, uh, --n4051a3 pay for paper to recycle --n4051c6,###i know you do yours at work,###but for newspaper.###.###uh-huh.###.###but ours are real hard to find --n40537f.###that's the one thing that --n40540b really discourages me.### i saved pa-, you know, i recycle paper,###but they,	###.###.###i mean, they're real hard to find --n405696 the places that --n4056a9 pay.
11425:65	###uh-huh.###.###but in, uh, in the paper one you have --n4065c8 to separate.###you have --n406679 to make sure you don't throw away any of the slick paper, like magazines.###.###uh-huh.###.###you can't throw any of that away###and you can't throw certain file type things away,###and i just think it's such a hassle,	###i don't know,###of course, i don't know all that about recycling###so, it probably is a hassle.
11427:24	###but in, uh, in the paper one you have --n4065c8 to separate.###you have --n406679 to make sure you don't throw away any of the slick paper, like magazines.###.###uh-huh.###.###you can't throw any of that away###and you can't throw certain file type things away,###and i just think it's such a hassle,###it seems like it would be, it --n40694c would be easy to take it all,###i don't know,	###so, it probably is a hassle.###.###uh-huh.
11448:47	###.###right,###right.###and we had, uh, a write up in our paper --n406f4c --n406f53, uh, this last time at work about, um,###they come and empty your trash###every other day they do your normal trash###and every other day they do your recycling trash.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###oh.###.
11469:14	###right,###right,###so they're, they're really, trying --n407711 to start --n407720 keeping an eye out for those, you know###talking to the people again about, you know,###separate them###because that is discouraging when you, when you do that --n407918.###it --n4079d5 was hard to get used to those two different trash cans.###.###uh-huh.###.	### and, and they'll, they'll start --n407b53 separating them.###because, i don't mind --n407c2f doing that,###i feel like i'm doing, uh, doing something for the community when i'm doing that --n407ce8.
11526:53	###this doctor discovers a drug that --n4007fb brings them back to the, the living, more or less,###but it wears off.###.###uh-huh.###.###and the way it wears off --n400970 is he goes through all these spastic, you know, uh,###it starts off with like a tic,###.###uh-huh.###.	###and it was just so realistic.###the way, you know, you have --n400c6e to just keep --n400c81 reminding yourself that he's an actor --n400ca4.###.
11607:33	### when i, each time that i thought that the indians were going --n401dec to get killed --n401dff --n401e06, i cried.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, i cried the first time when the, um, the wagon man got killed --n401f83 --n401f8a, when they attacked him --n401fa5.###.###uh-huh,###yeah,###yeah.###.	### let's see###what else did it.###um,
11658:17	###what did you think --n402b9e about the buffalo scenes.###.###oh, i thought it was awful, and so graphic,###.###that was,###.###.###yeah.###.###i mean i hadn't even imagined it, you know.	###.###uh-huh.###.
11720:24	###uh, have you seen any of the behind the scenes, uh, of, of that movie.###.###no,###huh-uh.###.###it was,###they tried --n403d81 to keep it, you know, as very close to real.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and, uh, they had --n403f25 to teach a wolf how --n403f40 to, to howl --n403f57.###.###oh.
11737:13	###i guess they're just not domesticated,### or, or,###.###yeah,###what,###they just don't howl that much anymore.###.###uh. that'll teach them in a couple minutes, huh.###.###i could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off	###.###.###yeah.
11839:213	###bye, bye.###.###okay.###bye-bye.###.###.###okay, uh,###could you tell me what you think --n400066 contributes most to, uh, air pollution.###.###well, it's hard to say --n400157.	###what do you think --n40059e.###.###um, well, you talked about, uh, volcanos.
11888:34	###and we get an occasional,###it depends which way the wind's blowing --n40108d from boston, cause we're like forty miles south of boston,###so we'll pick up that.###and, uh, i've noticed over the past say, maybe five or six years, uh,###we live about twenty miles away from the state airport###and i notice that the fly patterns --n401353 now of the jets are getting bigger,###they're swinging wider so that now they are coming over, over our homes.###.###uh-huh.###.	###i'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that --n4015e0's dropping.###but, other than that, you know, we don't have the, unless we're catching it from the midwest, the emissions. you know from the power plants.###.
11911:124	###one of our, our biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal --n401980 to, uh, generate electricity.###.###um,###.###um, there doesn't seem --n401aa1 to be much emission from them,###but i'm not sure about the rest of the country.###.###yeah,###i notice locally a major problem is kodak.###um, it's interesting	###uh, so people get up,###.###okay,
11942:22	###.###um, we've got reports that, uh,###during the night seems like they'd blow off their, their stacks from, uh, the warehouses, for powerhouses,###.###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, they do that at night too, because, employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted --n402874,	###.###right.###.
11972:154	###.###sure.###but, um, yeah,###i'm not sure how much the water pollution is, is directly related to the air pollution --n402de2, other than acid rain,###yeah,###.###acid rain,###yeah,### that's, that's what i was, uh,###.	###um, ye-,###i'm not an expert.###.
12066:13	###do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem.###i mean, i remember --n404ef6 reading an article that --n404f0d said like, it's, uh, the older polluters,### the, the twelve and fifteen year old cars, you know, contribute like ninety percent, of the automobile pollution###.###yeah,###.###and the new cars it's hardly is, hardly anything.###.###yeah,###they're better,	###uh, when was the last time you saw a truck that --n405347 didn't belch, smoke, or, uh,###.###yeah,
12288:10	###that's what i like --n4018fe to make --n40190d is just real neat stuff like that###but.###.###uh-huh.###.###kind of like the italian,###it's really good,###but instead i catered to their diet###so i made baked chicken in the crock pot###and, um, it was good and everything,	###.###but, it seemed kind of boring compared,###.
12297:27	###and, um, it was good and everything,###it had all the vegetables in it,###.###but, it seemed kind of boring compared,###.###it kind of, uh, kind of down played compared to what you would like --n401cee, huh.###.###right.###.###speakerb33-1*t33-1.	###speakeranan*t33-1.###speakera33-2*t33-2.###i find it changing the way that i eat --n401fc8, but not the way i entertain --n401fef,
12484:61	###.###yeah,###i'm,###i don't know the exact figure###but i, i would imagine that because of the, how close the, the vote was --n401727 i'm, uh, i mean almost certainly would have --n40175e to be.###just based on the sheer numbers of, uh, the disparity of, excuse me, democrats and republicans in congress he'd think that it would have --n4019a9 to have been, um.###.###that's right.###.###and, uh, i, i	###.###yeah.###.
12500:4	###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###i mean how many years are we going --n4020d7 to wait --n4020e6### and, and what, what do you do --n4021a1 with the people that --n4021b8 are over there in the mean time.###.###right,###right,###i think that was,	###.###no doubt.###.
12540:54	###that's right,###that's true.###that's interesting,###i think, uh, this political situation over there now is, uh, uh,###it --n4031d4'll be interesting to see what --n4031f7 comes out of it whether the, this opposition will, uh, uh,###today the turks, uh, agreed --n403368 to support the kurds, which --n403387 is something they've never done --n4033aa before### and, uh. and, uh, this,###.###um, interesting.###.	###so it's like,###.###well, baker is really not very much pro israel.
12698:41	### i, i don't, i don't like acid rock either.### i, i grew up in a small town###so, uh, the only, we only had one radio station###so it was country music,###.###yeah.###.###but then, uh, when i,###.###yeah,	###.###oh, really.###you're older than i am.
12746:22	###.### and, and, uh, so, i, i, i appreciate his too,### his, his mus-,###.###yeah.###.### he, he, he's from ireland isn't he.###.###yeah,###uh-huh,	###.###was i-,###yeah.
12758:28	###was i-,###yeah.###.###they had a band with him that, uh, --n4013fd had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that --n401430 played the bagpipes plus the, uh, tin whistle, and a couple of violins and, uh, drum,###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###it was just fabulous.###.###yeah,
12854:39	###no.###.###that is not,###i don't know what that is --n403120,###but that's not music.###.###if i can't understand the words i don't want --n4031fc to listen to it.###.###well, it's, it's, it's not, it's not music,### it's just, it's just, uh, uh, talking in a beat,	###.###yeah.###.
13047:20	###.###oh, we, we watch those award shows too,###we enjoy --n406064 watching the country and the grammies and stuff###but i just, i just don't care for him,###.###yeah.###.###i just never have.###i don't,###.	###.### is, is it.###.
13186:50	###.###yeah,###th-,### warped real easy.###.###and the ones you buy --n4085a0,### go out and buy one now and they're just so thin and, flimsy###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah.###.
13207:14	###yeah.###.###and so, the best bet, any, anymo-, these days are compact disk,###those things are practically indestructible.###.###but, i, i guess, you know, the old country and western music you,###back then when i was a kid --n408c1d, there wasn't that much t v,###.###oh, no.###.	###.###radio.###.
13426:57	###i agree.###.###.###yes,###i get some of these things --n400c8e in the mail that i wonder, where in the world did they get my address --n400cd5 or where did they get my name --n400cf8 --n400cff.###.###uh-huh.###.###and in fact, some of these things i get --n400e88, some of these questionnaires,###it's funny because i'm, i was in the process of filling one out when i decided i would make this phone call --n400fc5,	###but, when you have --n401262 to send that back in the mail with your name on it, your salary information --n4012a9, i, i just have a real hard time doing that,###uh, and they ask you what type of household items --n40146d do you own --n401480, like stereos and t v --s and v c r --s### and, and you hate --n4015a6 to send something --n4015b9 off with your name and address and what types of things do you own --n4015f8 and what kind of money do you make --n40161f
13512:158	###.###and, uh, i think those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, i can't really think of anything else --n402f90 offhand, that, uh,###.###i think i dislike the phone number part the worst.###i mean, it's, it --n403100's one thing to get junk mail because you can, you can just put it right in the trash,###but it's the phone calls,	###and they call you right when, when you've just gotten home from work --n40360e.###the last thing you want --n4036f1 is a phone call unless it's, you know, something halfway enjoyable,###but if it's a salesperson, it's just something you don't want --n403840 to have --n40384f to mess with --n403862.
13571:21	### but, so tho-, i guess those three things are the, uh, uh, most irritating to me.###.###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###i agree with the phone, too, in that,###i'm single,###but when i come home from work --n404b34, there's times i need --n404b57 to pay bills --n404b6a,###i need --n404c58 to balance my checking account,	###and even though it's friends calling, sometimes you just feel like, this is my quiet time,###i need --n404e80 to get things done --n404e97###and the phone ringing bothers me,
13597:119	###and the last thing you want --n40570e to do --n40571d is have --n405730 to answer the phone.###and if it's some salesman, that just makes it even that much worse.###and, uh, it just,###i get to where i, i turn the answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone --n405978,###but now with this thing i'm participating in --n405a92, i kind of have --n405aad to answer it, because you never know if it's the switchboard or if it's, uh, you know, somebody calling that you really don't want --n405b30 to talk on the phone.###.###well i have, now we have a, you know, voice mail system at, uh, at the office.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
13605:11	###uh-huh.###.###now what i have done --n405ed9 is, i have forwarded my home phone to the answering service at the office so that i do not have --n405f38 to have a, uh a ring at all. if i, if i want --n405f8b to do that.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.	###.###.###oh, huh.
13883:17	###.###and then you might have more control over, uh, the, the morals that they would be taught --n404a62 --n404a69 rather than in like a classroom or a day care center.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###i know the day care centers are not cheap either.###you know they're,###.###i haven't ever really looked at them.	###.###uh, well, no,###.
13918:57	###that's okay, too.###.###yeah,### i, i, i think that they will be more in the work place because, uh, the door's open.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, it --n405a72's just human nature to walk through an open door.### so, and i would be glad --n405b55 to see that.###i hope i don't see a lot more single moms,	###.###mumblex.###.
13984:26	###do you think it's a,###.###well, i, i think it's a pretty good idea.###i think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or --n400326 helping elderly people.###.###yes,###yes,###def-,###.### i, i, you know, i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that --n4004fa could use some help	###and i'm not sure that that's not a bad idea###.###that's true.
14017:22	### i, i really think that both the boy scouts and girl scouts is a excellent, two excellent organizations.###.###they are###but parents,###.###you know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old --n401505 they fall out of that,###.###yeah,###they do.###.	###there are very few scouts --n4016e8 go on, and become eagle scouts.###.###oh, no.
14060:53	###.###grab, grab, grab, walk out.###.###yeah,###you're absolutely right.###.###yeah###.###i think it's a really a good thing.### i, i like --n401f3d to see,	###.###yeah,###but there's a lot that --n40210f can be done --n402122 right here in this country, too.
14231:5	###.###.###and i always liked david brinkley###and i-, and i used --n403503 to enjoy john chancellor's style of reporting,###but on the nightly news, now, he goes into his commentary###and that's where i get, get into the problem with, with him --n4036b2.###i frequently disagree with his commentaries,###so.###.###well, once they've reported the facts,	###.###right.###what did you think --n40394b of the news coverage of the war.
14262:31	###.###i wondered if it would help you sometimes fill in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that other people, people like myself might not pick up on --n4041a3.###.###well, i, i think, uh, my background is probably what --n40432b absolutely turned me off with sixty minutes.###.###okay.###what weekly, um, magazine do you look at --n404481,###is it,###.###i like u s news and world report.	###.###uh-huh.###.
14287:23	###.###yeah.###.###uh, here's --n404a78 what --n404a83 went on in asia over the past week,###and there's maybe a page of that, little brief paragraphs, unless that was one of their, the focus of their main stories.###.###that sounds good###if you were short on time, you could get a summary real quick.###.###uh, it too is one those mumblex	###and i do most of my reading in the bathroom.###.###right.
14300:41	###right.###.###um, and it's one of those that i can ei-, read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that i'm going --n404ffa to spend --n405009 in there --n405018.###.###right.###.###and it just seems --n4051e8 to fit nicely, so that i can get it read --n40521b in about three days.###.###well, we're working on a newsweek, uh,###for the last couple of months we got, you know, an introductory subscription,	###so, we decided --n4055d5 to try --n4055e4 to bring one --n4055f7 in that --n405606 was a little bit better for us, so to speak.###.###well, to broaden your horizons, make you think about different things anyway.
14315:46	###it can't hurt,.###.###well, anytime that we stop and think --n405888 it can't hurt.###.###no.### i, i even, i enjoy --n405963 reading t news,###i try --n405a30 to catch it because it's another example,### they just, they just show you the words and the facts###and they, they don't offer any commentary,###and it gives me a quick chance to, to be caught --n405c55 up during the day.	###so, i don't like --n405e10 to go the whole day without --n405e2f hearing anything.###.###oh, i'm with you,
14370:83	###well, they did have a fairly decent year finally this year.###.###uh-huh.###.###at least they're coming around.###.###yeah,###they're going --n4002c0 to get better.###i mean, you know.###.	###.###yeah.###as long as troy ot-, aikman doesn't get hurt --n40055e again.
14436:61	### did he, did he actually play in the pro bowl.###i remember he was like a backup###and then somebody got injured --n401609###and he was supposed --n40165c to go.###.###i'm not sure.###.###yeah,### i kind of, i haven't been keeping up with football,###i mean, in the fall i, i can go on and on about football,	###but, uh,###.###who else is, --n401a32 uh, oh
14459:43	###bu-,###jerry burns.###.###no earthly idea.###.### goin-, ke-, he was going --n401eec to keep him as the coach somehow,###but, uh, i don't know,###i'd like --n40202d to see the vikings get revamped --n40204c somehow.###.###how did they end up --n4020f0 this year.	###.###well, they started out really bad,###they went like one and six,
14493:101	###in fact they were doing better than the cowboys,###and the cowboy, cowboys came on strong at the end of the season,###and the cardinals got killed --n4028af by the cowboys,###so.###.###yeah.###well, the cardinals,###i don't know.###i think the cowboys probably have a, a better team.###they just,	###of course, he sat along the sidelines all season,###he never really got in a game, never did a whole lot.###.
14494:26	###and the cowboy, cowboys came on strong at the end of the season,###and the cardinals got killed --n4028af by the cowboys,###so.###.###yeah.###well, the cardinals,###i don't know.###i think the cowboys probably have a, a better team.###they just,###at the end of the season, the kind of got messed --n402ae8 up with aikman getting hurt --n402b03, because, uh, laufenberg just couldn't ever really get it together at all.	###he never really got in a game, never did a whole lot.###.###oh, don't made any excuses for him.
14518:36	### i haven't, uh, i haven't kept up with it lately,###but i remember --n4034c6 reading something --n4034d5 a few months ago about them signing somebody else on, or, or trying --n403518 to go after somebody or trade for somebody,###but it wasn't anybody i'd really heard of --n4036b0.###but i heard on the radio this morning, or yesterday morning, that, uh, aikman's back in --n403790 practicing, doing real, real well.###um, who is it --n4038a3,###michael irvin###.###uh-huh.###.###mumblex he said that, uh, aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time.	###they're just trying --n403ae6 not to overwork him right now, until he gets his shoulder, uh, back in shap-,###it was his shoulder, wasn't it, that he had the problems with --n403c3f.###.
14590:42	###i was always a viking fan.###i think i was into the cardinals for a little bit###and,###.###uh-huh.###back when they were in saint louis --n404fe7.###.###yes,###oh, of course.###.	###i guess i've always been a cowboy fan.###other than that, i mean, you know, when i've, you know, when you grow up in a city that --n4052b8 has the, you know, one of the greatest football teams until the last few years --n405303, you kind of tend --n40531e to get caught --n405331 up in it.###.
14607:18	###yeah.###.###there's no question about that,###so.###.###yeah,###i mean it, it --n40572e was really exciting, growing up when, when the cowboys were really big --n405775.###.###.###because my parents would always have season tickets,	###and you know, the hype were just unbelievable.###it's just, you know, the last, oh###i guess probably since about eighty-four, about eighty-five was when they started --n405abc kind of going downhill really --n405ad7,
14611:89	###.###yeah,###i mean it, it --n40572e was really exciting, growing up when, when the cowboys were really big --n405775.###.###.###because my parents would always have season tickets,###and they'd go to all the games,###and you know, the hype were just unbelievable.###it's just, you know, the last, oh###i guess probably since about eighty-four, about eighty-five was when they started --n405abc kind of going downhill really --n405ad7,	###so, i can't, you know,###i'm not going --n405dde to decide i don't like them just because they're having a few bad years.###i mean, i think they'll pull out of it,
14631:10	###again.###.###yeah.###.###what are they going up to --n4064a7,###thirty bucks or something.###.###thirty, or thirty-two for really good tickets.###see, they, they sectioned it out even more.###they used --n406653 to just have like, uh,	###and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else.###and now they're sectioning it off to like from the, from one twenty yard line to the other one,###just on the lower levels is the highest price,
14631:18	###again.###.###yeah.###.###what are they going up to --n4064a7,###thirty bucks or something.###.###thirty, or thirty-two for really good tickets.###see, they, they sectioned it out even more.###they used --n406653 to just have like, uh,	###and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else.###and now they're sectioning it off to like from the, from one twenty yard line to the other one,###just on the lower levels is the highest price,
14640:20	###they used --n406653 to just have like, uh,###first of all it was all one price.###and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else.###and now they're sectioning it off to like from the, from one twenty yard line to the other one,###just on the lower levels is the highest price,###and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level,###and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line.###and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas,###and then the cheapest of course is going --n406bc4 to be the end, the direct end zones.###but, um, they have about four or five different prices --n406cd1 now, that they're structuring it with --n406cf8,	###.###so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year.###.
14748:68	###okay,###so, uh, what do you think, that, uh,### what do, what do, what do you think we can do --n400bf1 to solve the crime in america.###.###oh, if i knew that i'd be a very wealthy person.###.###yeah,###but what, what, what are the steps --n400e35.###.###well, you have --n400ee3 to see,	###or ha-, has crime increased,###and if so, why has crime increased --n401125.###.
14765:25	###.###because in the country, people still respect, uh, the property of other people.###.###right.###.###and so, as, as,###and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and they rush --n4017cd to get the same thing.###they say, why can't we have the same things that these other people have --n401880 --n401887,###and the thing that we can do --n401953 is, we need money for drugs,
14912:31	###yeah,###might.###.###did you see it.###.###nope,###i only heard about it.###.###okay,###in one part, the guy goes out of jail,	###.###uh-huh.###.
14965:23	###.###okay.###.###well, credit cards, boy, that's an easy topic,###.### ye-, yes,###.###isn't it.###.###it is.	###.###oh, yes,###yes.
15215:21	###i mean, the, the recording mentioned the peace corps.###.###well, it sounded like, i mean, this is like major long term commitment, like a year or six months,###.###yeah.###.### or, so you're looking at the peace corps or sabbatical maybe,###or, you know, i don't know,###i mean, but, uh,###.	###like i do some volunteer work here and there,###and every once in a while i'll do, uh, a, uh, local big brother big sister thing.###.
15271:19	###i think that maybe that's why some people do it --n402b3c is, uh, to see the other cultures or, you know and some of that.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, to do that,###i don't know,###i'd have --n402da0 to be,###i don't know.###.###oh, i don't know either.	### and, and none of this, you go --n40315b spend two years in the peace corps --n40317e to ex-, to broaden your horizons.###.###uh-huh. well, you know, uh, i know american express,
15419:16	###.###uh-huh.###.###and so she basically didn't use credit cards and didn't know very much about them and how they work --n4068eb, and, and how you can use them to your advantage --n40692e, and, and how, you know, you, you can do certain things with them --n406989.###.###huh.###.###.###yeah,### i always, i use everything with my visa,	###.###yeah.###.
15457:32	###.###oh, how funny.###.###yeah.###mumblex so we talked about the cowboys a little bit.###and, i'm out here in phoenix,###so we talked about phoe-, cardinals.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and then what else did i have --n40793c.###i think i had some other, uh, like staying in shape or working out.### this other guy, i got this guy from new york,
15466:26	###.### and, so, so that one was all right.###and then what else did i have --n40793c.###i think i had some other, uh, like staying in shape or working out.### this other guy, i got this guy from new york,###so.###.###i had --n407b6c to talk to someone about hobbies,###and the switchboard called me,###so i was caught --n407c4d a little off guard,	###so i started --n407d44 making stuff up.###i told this woman that my hobby was gardening,###and i can't even i can't even grow an ivy.
15511:13	###it's not,###the length isn't too long.###.###no.###.###uh-huh.###.###oh goodness no.###.###uh mumblex.	###.### you don't even, you don't even realize it, you know.###.
15600:84	###but other than that i've heard the, the, you know, the, um, the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful.###.###yeah.###.###.###and, uh, the costuming yeah, was,###.###uh-huh,###really.###.	###.###oh really.###.
15684:35	###so yeah, um,###that was so that he couldn't leave her,###cause she,###.###it still just seems a little twisted to me.###.###yeah,###yeah###i mean, yeah,###.	###.###well, as far as that goes,###yeah,
15962:91	###you're kidding.###.###no.### and so, and, and my boss has, has gone for about like three times, i think --n402ff4.###and i told him he's obviously in a high risk group.###.###the executives, right.###.###right,###right,	###.###.###the executives.
15999:6	###oh, what kind of drugs did you use --n4039e5, if you don't mind.###.###uh, marijuana, cocaine and amphetamines.###.###wow.###.###um, yes,###uh-huh.###.###.	###.###really.###.
16022:32	###life is so much more enjoyable.###.###.###uh-huh.###and i was losing jobs just from --n403e7c doing a poor job, you know.###.###yeah.###yeah,### that's, that's it.###.	###.###yeah.###just life in general.
16062:27	###.###yeah,###i mean, and they have, they have some serious chemicals out there you know,###.###yeah.###.###like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water, you know, that kind of thing --n4048d4.###.###yeah.###.	###.###oh, my gosh.###.
16108:56	###yeah.###.###and they, at that time, they had no testing whatsoever.###.###huh.###.###so that's scary.###.###yeah.###that reminds me of, uh,	###and i have just casually asked her what he did --n4057bd for a living.###and she said, oh, he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill, you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff --n4058c7.###.
16110:72	###and they, at that time, they had no testing whatsoever.###.###huh.###.###so that's scary.###.###yeah.###that reminds me of, uh,###i have a friend who --n40568d was telling me about her brother who --n4056b0 gets high all the time,###and i have just casually asked her what he did --n4057bd for a living.	###.###oh, lord.###.
16193:27	###.###um, yeah,###that's what it said to discuss --n40016a some###maybe a recipe,###well, it says, why would you, what you would have --n400252 for a dinner party.###um, this is strange because i pressed one and i thought it said begin.###.###oh.###.###okay,	###okay,###we'll talk for five minutes,###they interrupt at the end.
16382:10	###.###um, it filled,###a lot of people try --n403eb3 to stay away from this###but i make my own homemade pudding just because i don't like box pudding.###.###is that right.###i've never heard of that.###.###yeah,### it, and it mumblex if you, um, well,	###and i put it in a two quart saucepan###and you put it on a really low heat.###.

16630:8	###and willie nelson.###.###uh-huh.###so you like a, a variety.###.###yeah.###.###sort of easy listening because you like country###but then,###.	###i don't like that, when they start --n400582,###.###um.
16641:60	###i don't like that, when they start --n400582,###.###um.###.###i don't know.###i just like willie nelson i guess --n400671 because he's such a character.###.###oh, uh-huh.###yeah,### i, i like some of his songs, though.	###they're just kind of sweet sometimes.###.###yeah.
16683:10	###or you just like it.###.###very badly.###.###.###i've got a piano,###.###yeah.###.###my mother got a piano and, uh, vowed that someone in the family was going --n40119e to learn,	###and i was the one that --n401307 did the least poorly,###so she gave it to me.###.
16839:10	###.###did you like them.###.###yeah,###i like moody blues.### i, i like mostly the older groups i think --n4044bd.###oh, c-,###but we do have,###i like simply red,###we got simply red.	###and, uh, i like breeze,###i like the group.###i think just because they all sort of sound, they sound l-, a lot like r-, uh, simply red.
16868:31	###yeah.###.###you know, how many people --n404e74 are in simply red, stuart,###he can't hear me.### i, i don't remember how many people,###but, it's, it's got men and women###and it's not, it's, it's nice,###i mean it's pleasant, you know, music.###it's not where it's, it hurts your ears --n405250 to hear it --n405263.###but it's not as, it's not like, uh, chicago where it's got that much instrument to it --n405390.	###.###yeah.###.
16906:40	###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###oh, okay.###.###just because there's a friend up there,###not because there's much else.###.###oh, okay.	###that's why i was just w-,###.###for colleges.
17010:170	###.###hopefully.###.###but there's probably something else that --n407b70 might make you.###because you could know about, you could know about the crime, but not necessarily be taken --n407c6c off the jury, you know, not be accepted --n407c9b for j-, the jury.###.###yeah.###.###i mean, pretty much a lot of people would know about it, you know, and, and know some of the different things about it###but, uh, they, they might weed you out some other way.	###.###the death penalty. no.###.

18704:112	###oh, well, it sounds like you're pretty much into computers.###.###well, i sure need them.###uh, there's no way that i could begin --n402c17 to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need --n402c66 --n402c6d to, to try --n402c84 to do my job --n402c9b without them.###.###i can believe that.###well, it's, it's been interesting.###.###yes,###uh, maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things --n402fcc.	###.###yeah,###of course, needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing.
18735:25	###but i didn't know they had a four eighty-six just yet.###.###it does a few more things, uh, than had been available before.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement. uh, you know,	###.###sure.###.
18767:46	###uh, in the houston area.###.###uh-huh.###well, i used --n4000e2 to.###i lived there for a long time.###but i'm now in palo alto, california which --n4001cd is, i think --n4001e8, the recycling capital of the world.###.###oh, that's great.###.###so, we have many recycling activities	###.###oh, we are too.###our community is, uh, just starting --n4004e7 to get organized about it.
18779:38	###oh, we are too.###our community is, uh, just starting --n4004e7 to get organized about it.###they just opened up a recycling center where we go --n4005af and donate our, our things and dump them off ourselves.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, it,###.###well, that's something###but it, it seems to me that we've gotten a whole lot better, um, cooperation out here, uh, by --n4007db setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra, uh,	###but the, uh, garbage men, come by, uh, on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb.###.###uh-huh.
18812:30	###and the garbage men come by and, uh, collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty --n401275 or leave the ones if they're still in good shape.###.###oh, that's great.###.###and, the, it really pays for itself because, oh, then the city, gets the money from the recycling.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,	###our, um,###we've got several bins in our, on, in our garage where we, uh, you know, sort things out --n4016c3 and, and take it to, to the appropriate places.###.
18854:16	###i wish they would do that here.###we have got so little landfill space left that we're going --n4024ed to run out before the end of this decade.###.###yes.###.###and it's really going --n402628 to be a mess when they have --n40264b to start --n40265a hunting for places to put the things --n402685 --n40268c.###.###oh, i know it.###.###we did have, uh, another novel, uh, experiment start this year.	###.###oh.###.
18868:16	### you can, you buy these super giant heavy-duty paper bags,###they're about four-feet high.###.###uh-huh.###.###and you get them for i think it's --n402a97 about fifty cents apiece at the grocery store###you, um, usually buy them by the dozen.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###oh, uh-huh.###.
18877:36	###.###and then you put all your lar-, yard clippings and, uh, leaf rakings and anything that --n402c5b will be compostible.###.###oh, uh-huh.###.### and those and they, the garbage men also pick those up on thursdays.###.###oh, that's great.###.###and then the, uh, they take them to a special part of our dump where composting is now in full swing --n402f36,	###.###right,###well, that's a great idea.
18952:42	###and they say, y-, as long as it's clean###they don't want a plastic bag that --n404a2d's full of goop.###.###yes.###.###here they don't want your rotted tomatoes.###.###.###but they want any clean and dry plastic bag###so i keep,	###so right outside the back door, i've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles --n404daf,###.###uh-huh.
18974:26	###.###oh, yeah.###.###and he'll go --n405285 pick them up because he just can't stand that.### he, he,###.###well, how nice,###that's great.###.###and, uh, it's so, you know,	###.###uh-huh.###.
18988:13	###i remember at christmas the, the only thing that i'm,###when you were talking about the composting --n4056b1, the only thing that our city did --n4056d8 that was they di-, uh, provided a place for us to take our christmas trees. uh, to for them to mulch --n405763. for, for city use --n405782.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###well, that's,	###.###uh-huh.###.
19009:23	###and, uh, otherwise you would have --n405ccd to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse.###it would have --n405dbb to be cut --n405dce into four-foot lengths.###.###.###so, you know, if we have branches or something, they have --n405e8f to be cut --n405ea2 in four-foot lengths,###.###uh-huh.###.###but otherwise, uh, they have --n405fb2 to be in one of their paper bags.###.	###.###and they even picked up our, uh, styrofoam pl-, packing materials.### they brought, uh, the week after christmas they left a plastic bag --n406274 on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying, we're trying something new next week only,
19020:24	###.###and they even picked up our, uh, styrofoam pl-, packing materials.### they brought, uh, the week after christmas they left a plastic bag --n406274 on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying, we're trying something new next week only,###if you have any, uh, of those little, uh, styrofoam peanuts that, any of your christmas presents were packed --n40648c in --n406497, put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###well, see that's one,
19041:17	###.###well, those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills.###.###oh, yeah,###i mean, they don't, uh, uh,###.###they don't mash.###.###no.###.	###and they stay forever.###.###right.
19059:61	###and i think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines.###.###yeah,###i do too.###the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile.### it, they really have --n407135 to rely on businesses that --n407150 generate a lot of that stuff.###.###right.###.###uh, because otherwise, uh, you know, they're not going --n4072a3 to go house-to-house --n4072b6 collecting it,	###.###uh-huh.###.
19269:7	###yeah.###.###whereas, you know, if the soviet union would have, who --n403d93 knows what taking over mongolia or, or something like that, who --n403dde is really, will we have been more just rhetoric, uh, rather than --n403e29 going in there officially or, you know, physically and try --n403e60 to, to remove them.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###well, the, the china situation, you know, the when, it looked like that thing was, was turning around --n40419b	###.###and that's enough.###.
19310:30	###.###well, the, uh, the social structure of the soviet union, you know, it, it's, it's coming apart at the seams.###.###speakera68-1*t68-1.###uh-huh.###speakerbnan*t68-1.###speakerb68-2*t68-2.###you know, and i've heard people say, well, you know, it's just like the american civil war,###will there be a union or not.###well, no,	###there was no,###speakeranan*t68-2.###.
19341:54	###a lot of my friends have a taken us down, the stance of, you know, these people are just trying --n4056a5 to be free and trying --n4056c0 to get away###and i'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic, you know,###speakerbnan*t73-2.###.###if i'm a soviet and if part of, you know, south, let's say --n40592b south dakota wanted --n40593e to succ-, you know, succeed, am i going --n405971 to stand for that.###.###speakerb75-1*t75-1.###yeah.###speakeranan*t75-1.###speakera75-2*t75-2.	###speakerbnan*t75-2.###.###i'm not that familiar with their future,
19379:56	###.###and then the russians even, took it back from the germans and never bothered --n406699 to give it back, you know,###.###yep.###.###so. that's a, a little different situation.###.###.###well, that whole a,###.	###.###uh-huh.###and that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers --n406b4c
19389:65	###the whole i-, idea if you look at the russian history and i guess all countries the way it used --n4068cd to be --n4068dc is, the only way to truly protect your borders --n406917 was to have a buffer.###.###uh-huh.###and that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers --n406b4c###and maybe, you know, more and more people are seeing, oh, countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer isn't going --n406c32 to help you,###you can,###.###well, i guess like, with, uh, israel is a perfect example.###.###yeah.	### and, and lebanon was just as a buffer###.###speakera98-1*t98-1.
19409:114	###speakerb99-1*t99-1.###they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers.###speakeranan*t99-1.###speakera99-2*t99-2.###yeah,###speakerbnan*t99-2.###speakera100-1*t100-1.### there's, there's very little that, that --n4072d9 binds you anymore in today's technology.###speakerbnan*t100-1.###speakerb100-2*t100-2.	###speakeranan*t100-2.###.###and they're going --n407690 to land in other places,
19467:92	###right.###.###.###exactly.###.###i get confused between all the, which --n40856f is the soviet provinces versus which --n40858e are the, the russian provinces, versus what --n4085b9 are,###.###.###uh-huh.###well, in the center	###.###was there nineteen of them or, or whatever,###.
19472:22	###i get confused between all the, which --n40856f is the soviet provinces versus which --n40858e are the, the russian provinces, versus what --n4085b9 are,###.###.###uh-huh.###well, in the center###but you got a, the, the great big area that --n4087a5's just, was traditionally known --n4087d0 as russia and then all these little nationality groups, around it, you know, that --n40881b were, you know,###.###was there nineteen of them or, or whatever,###.###uh-huh.	###.###they had some real fancy names for them.###.
19529:20	###wh-, uh, w-, what do you get shot --n4096ef by --n4096fa###.###speakerb139-1*t139-1.###something that --n40978a's called --n409799 a, an economic force or what --n4097bc is called --n4097cb a military pact,###speakeranan*t139-1.###speakera139-2*t139-2.###yeah,###speakerbnan*t139-2.###.###exactly.	###you can change the name of something###.###but i wonder if it's still, exists.
19540:23	###you can change the name of something###.###but i wonder if it's still, exists.###.###uh-huh.###although, i've seen some evidence that, you know, the, uh, the russian soldiers are,###well, you,###the funny thing there is they're not particularly welcome back home because there's, they're having housing shortages now.###.###speakerb143-1*t143-1.	###speakeranan*t143-1.###speakera143-2*t143-2.###exactly

19648:38	###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, the last, uh, i'm embarrassed --n40122a to say the last, you know, honest to gosh, cover to cover book that i read --n401285, i can not, right offhand, i tried --n4012b4 to read, uh, one of the, the michener, uh, lone star or the, the texas history book.###.###i have never been able --n4015b7 to make it through any of michener's work.###.###oh, well, i've had similar problems.###it does tend --n401704 to, to,###.	###.###yeah, as a matter of fact,###yeah.
19680:19	###yeah,###i think it was battle cry of freedom.###.###battle cry of freedom.###.###it's kind of like a historical compendium, of the civil war,###.###yeah.###.###and it's not a story of the civil war,	###.###uh-huh.###.
19697:50	###there was a lot more to it than that, weren't there.###.###there was a lot more to it than that.###as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that --n4023e0 kind of become like an afterthought.###.###yeah,###well, it was a political move.###.###oh, yeah.###.	###all the other areas which --n40284e would, i think at that time would have included west virginia and, oh, may have been --n4028a5 kentucky, a few states, you know, that --n4028d4 were not part of the south but still had slaves.###.###uh-huh.
19726:20	###.###.###and i have two native texan children too.###.###yeah.###.###my husband is always, you know, talked about th-, texas being a, uh, rebel state.###.###uh-huh.###.	###i kept --n402ffa waiting for,###where's some reference to this goddamn state of texas and the role that they played --n403093 either leading up to --n4030aa or in --n4030b9 the civil war --n4030cc.###.
19852:33	### i, i used --n405447 to read a lot more than i do now.###.###well, i've gone to the point where my husband, my husband travels, i get out like, you know, two or three books --n40559a.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i, i'm trying --n4056f4 to think of, oh, isaac asimov, robot series.###.###yeah.###.	###and i understand that there's a fifth.###.###uh-huh.
19910:29	###i've got, uh,###.###is that a big, thick book.###.###yeah,### and i've got, yeah, and i've got a history of kingsley, iowa.###.### what the, what the hell for --n406b6d.###why kingsley, iowa.###.	###.###oh, okay.###.
19940:15	###i don't know if i'd call it science fiction or fantasy.###.###sometimes it's awful hard,###some of those get very philosophical###they can be in any setting,###they just happen --n407364 to put them in a futuristic setting, you know,###the,###.###well, i loved that novel.###and then somebody said, oh, god, this would have been even long ago because i was in boston	###and i had a hole in my roof###and i was waiting for the whole house to collapse,###and, uh, i was reading dune. which --n407707 seeming rather ironic.
19985:106	###patrick stewart was in that.###i guess the guy that --n407f55's on the new star trek series was in that thing, uh.###.###i don't know,###i just remember sting was in it.###.###oh, really..###.###yeah,###and if you were trying --n408176 to follow any type of, uh, plot, it, it total-,	###.###uh-huh.###.
20014:15	###yeah.###.###that's true.###have you read, the silence of the lambs.###.###no.###somebody who, --n4087a4 saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they'd ever seen --n4087ff,###.###oh.###.	###.###well, see i, i am debating whether or not i want --n4089ac to go --n4089bb see the movie after --n4089d2 having read the book.###.
20074:4	###and he's suave###and he's all the charac-, all the, characteristics,###.###oh the worst kind,###yeah,###.###.###yeah.###.###yeah,	###.###.###well, how, how do you feel --n400032 about the immigration laws.
20134:27	###.###yeah.###well, uh, my, uh, my family is from, uh, europe from, well, from england and ireland and, uh, have been in this country for, oh, more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###oh, my.###.###so, i don't have any, any, uh, relatives that i am, or, or, uh, several generations back, that i am familiar with --n401c95 their names and how they fit into the family --n401cc0.	###.###uh-huh.###.
20214:68	###okay,### let's see.###i think, uh,###i guess, if i call i'm supposed --n4000e6 to start.###i think, uh, that's the way everybody has done it so far --n4001cd.###.###okay.###.###but, anyway i think that, um, we are paying a lot in taxes,###but i think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms, and we have a lot of things that the governments do --n4003e0 with our money.	###the, you know,###as far as the quality of the streets, the school systems, um, the hospital stuff that the government gives money to --n40074d. um, the, you know, all the things that the government does --n400790 like that. i, uh, i think they need --n4007c7 to manage it a little bit better,###but i don't think, uh, anybody is just going --n400a41 to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks, because they've been messing it up for many years, now.
20216:98	###i think, uh,###i guess, if i call i'm supposed --n4000e6 to start.###i think, uh, that's the way everybody has done it so far --n4001cd.###.###okay.###.###but, anyway i think that, um, we are paying a lot in taxes,###but i think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms, and we have a lot of things that the governments do --n4003e0 with our money.###um, we're probably one of the, the only countries in the world that --n40055d has all the things that we have --n400580.###the, you know,	###but i don't think, uh, anybody is just going --n400a41 to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks, because they've been messing it up for many years, now.###so,###.
20229:142	###.###i have --n400c1f to agree that.###.###yeah.###.###and you're right.### we, i mean, we, you know, we do have a good government.###we do have a lot of things that, you know, that, you know, the taxes are there to support --n400e6d,###but i do think they're mismanaged###and i think that sometimes it's too easy of a, i don't know, to easy of an answer.	###.###huh-uh.###.
20317:17	###i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there.###.###no.###no.###i've just lived here,###.###yeah.###.###but, i don't know,###i do,	### where, what did they say --n402bf3 to, uh,###i can't think of the scripture.### render unto caesar's what --n402d06 is caesar's.
20393:13	### i've, i spends a lot of time with our income tax, though. this, especially, this year and last year.###um, i have been married --n4041d1 for just a few years,###so i've had --n404263 to really switch around from the e z form to the, uh,###.###schedule a.###.###right.###.###well, yeah.###.	###.###did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act --n404427, it seemed like it made everything harder.###.
20424:33	###.###and that was one of the main pluses that we have --n40480e about --n404819 buying a house.###.###and it will help tremendously.###.###yeah.###.###we bought ours five years ago###and it's the one thing,###it seems like you make those payments every month	###.###right.###.
20611:26	###because that's,###i work with elma.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah.###.###yeah.###.###and i used --n4071b3 to work,	###.###oh, wow.###.
20616:22	###yeah.###.###yeah.###.###and i used --n4071b3 to work,### i, i did all of their capital and financial planning for about eight years.###.###oh, wow.###.###and then i have been in human resources for the last two years	###so, i feel kind of part of the staff.###.###yeah.
20743:39	###.###they'll help you, recycle, because we, there is some bins, like behind wal-mart, that --n10954 take some things.###.###.###well, now have they moved them behind wal-mart.###.###yeah.###.###oh, god.###.	###and there was nowhere else to take them --n10c35###and they had it in front of wal-mart###and i ask in wal-mart
20757:11	###and they said they moved it just behind.###.###oh.###that's really nice to know --n10e2e, because we were doing the same thing.###because --n10eff to take it to a metco, you have --n10f2a to take it when they're open --n10f4d, you know, which --n10f68 is always a real pain.###.###huh-uh.###.###and so when that thing came up in wal-mart parking lot --n110ff, we thought, oh, this is great.###and we started --n111ee taking them up there.	###i didn't know.###and we're going, oh, no, there goes our recycling place.###.
20785:62	###.###that's about what we do --n118a4 too.###.###and really, that's about, that's really about it.###is there anything, any place else that --n119f4 really takes anything other than that, that you know of --n11a27.###.###well, i guess, um, down in, kind of in north dallas, there is a place that --n11b83 will take almost anything.###.###oh, really.###.	###.###i know.###.
20882:22	###i don't.###i have a friend, of mine --n1371e told me about this program, is the reason that i'm,###.###no.###.###.###yeah.###there was a,###t i has got this organization called t a d which --n138d1 is t i'ers against drugs.###and, you know, we're recycling aluminum cans --n139cf up here and, uh, just what you would buy --n13a02 out of the machines and drink --n13a21 here	###and that's,###they use the money from that --n13c63 to fund this t i'ers against drugs program.###it's, you know,

20987:46	###.###of course, i have --n400c47 to watch cartoons --n400c5a on saturday morning, but not the ninja turtles.###i like the old-timey ones, tom and jerry.###.###.###yeah.###you sound like my husband.###.###there you go.###.	###.###right.###.
21109:12	###huh-uh.###.###.###huh-uh.###.###i was just a youngster###and i was like, oh, my gosh.###.###yeah,###we used --n402f1a to,	###and as the world turns. i think as the world turns may, still on or not.###.###still be on.
21218:49	##, i mean, i don't think they have anything in common,###.###.###um, quantum, leap has, i mean quantum leap is kind of a comedy in its own way, i guess --n400440,###but, uh, mostly it's, it's kind of science fiction,###and, it's, um, it's adventure and things like that###.###uh-huh.###.###and then night court is just pure, you know, weird fun, you know,	###so, i don't know why the two of them happen, --n4008d1 to be my two favorite shows --n4008f0,###.###.
21258:149	### i, i just,###it's,###i find him degrading at times.###i guess that is the point,###but sometimes it just,###.###well, they, they really have changed him though.### if, if you've watched it this season, um, he's becoming, i mean, he still is in his own way degrading and everything,###but, uh, he's involved in that charity,###and, uh, it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought, that he really has,	###.###oh.###.
21336:50	###the second lady.###.###yeah,###the second one the blond###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###.	###.###they didn't.###.
21366:46	###and this other girl was not,###and, you know, you kind of, you're wondering, you know, well when did this happen --n4038c5.###.###right.###.###so, yeah,### i, i kind of agree with that.###.###and i like the new lady better,###but i'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there.	###.###well, i'm afraid that's what they, they really wanted --n403cb0 to do --n403cbf, um,###.
21417:19	###.### and, and,###.###but it's, it --n404d5a's always been a formula, uh, for t v that the minute that two people, that the two main stars get married --n404dc9 --n404dd0, that the show ends up, you know, --n404dff dying.###.###yeah.###.### a, a, good example of this,###and, you know, this is probabl-,###maybe it's not a good example.	###they had get smart for, uh, ten hours a day, from seven o'clock at night, until six or until five o'clock the next morning. all the get smart episodes you could ever see --n405317.###.###oh.
21422:34	###yeah.###.### a, a, good example of this,###and, you know, this is probabl-,###maybe it's not a good example.###i've been watching nickelodeon all last week, because they had what they called --n4051b7 maximum smart.###they had get smart for, uh, ten hours a day, from seven o'clock at night, until six or until five o'clock the next morning. all the get smart episodes you could ever see --n405317.###.###oh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
21499:109	###well, i i hardly ever watch it,###.###usually tuesday nights i'm out,###so.###.###but, as, as i've seen it, they've, they've done sort of the same thing to where they've, they started --n406ddf to let them get together --n406dfa,###and then they pulled them apart###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
21567:37	###yeah,###it's,###they wouldn't be easy.###.###yeah.###.###so, um, well that's kind of interesting.###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah,###i think we've covered our time.
21760:9	###so when i was like fourteen, fifteen --n4028f9, i went, i went to turkey.###.###oh,###.###and this christmas, i went to turkey.###but basically, it's a,###for the past couple of years, i,###since my parents are, are, well,###i'm from argentina,###and my parents live down there.	###.###uh-huh.###.
21790:37	###.###yeah.###.###because, uh, my dad died, you know, when i was less than a year old --n4033d4###.###yeah.###.###so i always just had a mother.###so i always thought, when i have kids --n40352d, you know, i really want --n403550 to be involved --n403563 with them.###.	###so he could buy us material things.###.###material things,
21822:115	###and it's always the same man###.###uh-huh.###.###and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old,###and he wants --n403fd6 to be best friends###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, you know, it's like, i can only express myself so much,	###it's like, you know, i love you###and let's go out and do things together when i don't feel like it --n4044fe, you know###.
21866:59	###we have --n40510d to take them, and, you know to do it.###.###yeah.###.###and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while###because you're saying, well, i work full time too, you know.###.###yeah,###yeah,###but, uh, it's just, it's just something that, you know,	###what i'll do --n40565f is, you know, like,###i mean, you might have problems,###but it's not your kids' problems you know,
21884:10	###and you got --n40585b to try --n40586a to be with them as much as you can and to, you know, like,###thing is, is, that, you know, like if, if they would ever happen --n405a07 to have a drug problem, suppose, that they could feel comfortable --n405a46 coming to me and saying, i got a problem you know,###.###problem,###uh-huh###.### and, uh and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time, you know,###.###yeah.###.	###and let's see how we can get rid --n405e61 of the problem --n405e74, you know,###and that's uh, that's very, that's very hard to do --n405f98,###because once you're best friends with your parents, then, i think everything go a lot better.
22142:94	###um, so many of the kids are drop outs.###um, uh, there's a lot of drugs that --n403307 go on, and that they just have hopeless lives.### they, they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels.###i think education helps a little bit there.###um, then again, i don't know really what steps --n403551 there are --n403560 that they,###.###well, what they, what they say they try --n403654 to do --n403663 is to get the kids, um, early and --n403696 young.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
22228:24	###uh-huh.###.###and we don't have it,###so we deserve it,###and we should take it.###.###uh-huh,###yeah.###i don't know how you combat that --n405010.### i, i don't know where you start or, with a lot of these kids --n4050d1,	###.###yes.###.
22325:21	###.###uh-huh,###no,###in san antonio it was like every day,###it was just a matter of who --n406f9e was shot --n406fad that night,###.###i know it###but san antonio is considered --n407091 a nice clean city, believe it or not.###.###.	###.###uh-huh,###oh, yeah,
22349:15	###uh-huh,###very much.###when we moved here to monterrey --n4074e3 it was a big change, because it's such a small community,###we're just above carmel,###and, um, there's hardly,###most everybody seems pretty well employed around here,###and um, those that --n407710 aren't,###there's celinas which --n40778e is about a fifteen minute drive, which --n4077b5 is mostly migrant workers,###and there's a lot of crime there, um,###migrant hispanic farm workers, people that --n40792f are down and out,	###so, it's, it's pretty quiet. you know,###we walk the streets at night,###and, uh, people run in the park,
22443:59	###i have no idea.###i know, i,###my home is in, uh, pensacola, florida###.###uh-huh.###.###so, it's, they do a lot of shark fishing in that, you know, in the gulf###.###right.###.	###and, you know, there's part, either as part of --n401157 or separate from --n40116a the, uh, bill fishing tournaments they usually have --n40119d###so, i have not done, uh, much freshwater fishing oh, for, you know, lake, lake fishing for bass and so forth but, uh, maybe some what they call --n401352 brim and those sorts of things, but nothing,###.
22652:10	###hand picked.###.###that right.###.###the weirdest fishing experience i ever had --n404ca0. people to this day are still trying --n404cc7 to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught --n404d02.###we were in, uh, rockport, which --n404e72 is close to corpus###.###uh-huh.###.###and we had been fishing in a canal,	###and, uh, we'd been fishing in the canals###and all we were catching --n4050c2 were catfish,###and we were pretty bored with that.
22654:7	###that right.###.###the weirdest fishing experience i ever had --n404ca0. people to this day are still trying --n404cc7 to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught --n404d02.###we were in, uh, rockport, which --n404e72 is close to corpus###.###uh-huh.###.###and we had been fishing in a canal,###they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area,###and, uh, we'd been fishing in the canals	###and we were pretty bored with that.###so, we thought well, maybe there are some crab in here,###we'll try --n405259 to catch some crab.
22658:24	###.###uh-huh.###.###and we had been fishing in a canal,###they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area,###and, uh, we'd been fishing in the canals###and all we were catching --n4050c2 were catfish,###and we were pretty bored with that.###so, we thought well, maybe there are some crab in here,###we'll try --n405259 to catch some crab.	###i had a rock --n4053a7 to weight it down,###something grabs and just runs with it.###and of course there's no hook,
22799:98	###.###and, uh, she put him in,###but he wasn't there very long before he died###.###uh-huh.###.###but, um, i guess, um, the one time that i saw him there --n10aa1, you know, as far as the surroundings, that seemed okay.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah.###.
22893:70	###.###there's one close to where my mother is --n1211c,###but in order to get in, you have --n121c4 to be able --n121d7 to, um, walk in on your own,###in other words, you can't be in, you know, too bad a shape --n1231f to start out with.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.	###.###ca-,###yeah.
22916:31	###off,###yeah.###.###but then, you don't want --n12901 to go --n12910 do that when you don't have --n12933 to --n12942 because like, uh, you have --n12965 to give up your automobile or whatever.###.###to,###no.###.###.###uh-huh,	###.###yeah###.
22944:17	###.###uh-huh.###.###but of course, i would never be able --n130cd to afford --n130dc to put my parents in something like that, you know,###.###yeah,###that's the problem###.###that's way out of my reach.###.	###and, uh, what i, another thing i hate --n13357 to see --n13366 is when someone has a small amount of money, and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately --n133d5.###.###oh, yeah.
22945:133	###uh-huh.###.###but of course, i would never be able --n130cd to afford --n130dc to put my parents in something like that, you know,###.###yeah,###that's the problem###.###that's way out of my reach.###.###the expense of it all is,	###.###oh, yeah.###.
23013:12	###some of those places have wonderful activities and things, you know, lots of stuff going on.###.###oh, yes,###uh-huh.###.###and they'll take them places###.###yeah.###.###so. i don't know,	###.###no.###.
23080:111	###how are we doing in recycling --n4000a8.###are we,###.###well, i think we need --n400148 to do more.###i mean, i know i need --n4001f7 to do more.###they have programs --n4002a7 around where you can reach the, uh,###they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled --n40038d up.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah.###.
23097:155	###i do a lot of work with the boy scouts,###and we try --n4007df to do a lot###.###uh-huh.###.###but there's still a lot more we can do --n40088a.###.###yeah.###.###you know, i don't recycle my newspapers myself,	###.###uh-huh.###.
23215:14	###see, i work at t i.###.###yeah,###so does --n40328c my husband,###yeah.###.###we do a lot of recycling out there.###.###uh-huh.###.	###but that's just now come on board.###.###uh-huh.
23265:33	###.###and it's just got happy birthday printing on it, and a cute little phrase inside,###and it's just a paper bag###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, and it's really cute.###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah###.
23390:17	###myself.###about the only thing i really recycle --n406137 around here is aluminum cans.###.###uh-huh.###.###so.###.###well, i need --n406225 to get, get better at it.###so.###.	###.###yeah,###that's right,
23427:110	###all right,###.###bye-bye.###.###bye-bye.###.###.###okay, uh,### let's see,### i, i believe in the trial by jury.	###and i also like the unanimous decision because you have --n40036e to persuade everybody --n400381 to be a hundred percent, absolutely sure before you convict somebody.### i, i really agree with the, uh, innocent until proven --n4004ea guilty theory.###i think that's, that's a good way to do it --n400600.
23431:13	###bye-bye.###.###.###okay, uh,### let's see,### i, i believe in the trial by jury.###i think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for, uh, payoffs, you know, briberies, uh, unfairness, one-sidedness, you know, all those kinds of things.###and i also like the unanimous decision because you have --n40036e to persuade everybody --n400381 to be a hundred percent, absolutely sure before you convict somebody.### i, i really agree with the, uh, innocent until proven --n4004ea guilty theory.###i think that's, that's a good way to do it --n400600.	###.###well, i think, i think basically we're in a lot of agreement, uh, in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs, uh, some kind of legal definition.###.
23519:30	###.###and let's, you know, let's get rid --n402e07 of some of this harassment suing.###.###right,### that's, that's a good idea.###i,###in the bible it says, uh, if you have something against somebody, to go to them first, and if that doesn't work, then to go --n40305b get somebody, you know, a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them, and if that doesn't work, to take it to the whole church.###so that's right off that same kind of principle.###.###you bet,	###.### that's a, that's a good idea.###.
23599:17	### what, what part of the country are you from --n404996.###.###i'm living here in texas.###.###oh, okay,### in, in texas.###okay,###i was just being curious.###okay.###.	###.###yeah,###well, i'm from the dallas area.
23647:13	###well, we got, um, a lot of, uh, european dishes.###.###uh-huh.###.### we got, we got what some people call --n4002aa the best beef in the world.###.###yes.###.###so it's, uh, bishu,###like every sunday you go out,	###and then you just cook them over a grill.###that's,###like, in our house, it's already built --n4005a9 in.
23654:93	###.###so it's, uh, bishu,###like every sunday you go out,###and you buy all these parts of the cow,###and then you just cook them over a grill.###that's,###like, in our house, it's already built --n4005a9 in.###there's this whole special place in the back###so you can make a barbecue.###.	###.###yeah.###.
23697:28	###but like, like when i'm down at home --n400edc###.###yeah.###.###and like somebody says okay, when are, when are we having this --n400fc5, you know,###and i'll cook it.###.###oh.###.###you know, like you have --n40112e to prepare the fire, and then put the sausages on,	###.###do you buy them, um, separately at, you know, an american grocery store now,###or do you have --n4013e0 to,
23704:39	###oh.###.###you know, like you have --n40112e to prepare the fire, and then put the sausages on,###and then, you know, you put all these different meats which --n401244 take different times.###.###do you buy them, um, separately at, you know, an american grocery store now,###or do you have --n4013e0 to,### you don't, you don't go --n401452 buy it from a wholesaler.###.###no,	###.###little butcher shops,###yeah.
23801:56	###and since --n402a1c being argentinean we also have a lot of pasta.###.###yeah,###well,###.###and, you know,###.###because there're many italians in argentina.###.###yeah,	###.###uh-huh.###.
24022:17	###.###yeah.###okay,###i thought it was maybe like, you know, like five fifty or something.###.###oh, no,###no,###no,###no,###no	###it's one of the chinese cooking basics.###.###oh, okay.
24051:48	###bye-bye.###.###.###okay, um,###well, the first thing, uh, what do you think you would offer --n400087 as far as, uh, information about selecting a school.###.###well, first i think they've got --n4001e2 to have a pretty good idea of what they want --n400211 to, what they want --n40022c to do --n40023b.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah, uh,### do you, do you feel that the first two years that the, um,
24051:72	###bye-bye.###.###.###okay, um,###well, the first thing, uh, what do you think you would offer --n400087 as far as, uh, information about selecting a school.###.###well, first i think they've got --n4001e2 to have a pretty good idea of what they want --n400211 to, what they want --n40022c to do --n40023b.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah, uh,### do you, do you feel that the first two years that the, um,
24051:179	###bye-bye.###.###.###okay, um,###well, the first thing, uh, what do you think you would offer --n400087 as far as, uh, information about selecting a school.###.###well, first i think they've got --n4001e2 to have a pretty good idea of what they want --n400211 to, what they want --n40022c to do --n40023b.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah, uh,### do you, do you feel that the first two years that the, um,
24055:81	###well, the first thing, uh, what do you think you would offer --n400087 as far as, uh, information about selecting a school.###.###well, first i think they've got --n4001e2 to have a pretty good idea of what they want --n400211 to, what they want --n40022c to do --n40023b.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, once they have that, then they can start --n4003e2 looking in all the various publications that --n400405 give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves, and start --n40044c finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of, uh, of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer --n4004c3.###.###yeah, uh,### do you, do you feel that the first two years that the, um,	###but i know there are some fields where it's really not necessary --n400a1b.###.###yeah,
24162:34	###i mean, that's, that's where i wanted --n402ac4 to be --n402ad3,###but i didn't want --n402bc1 to go through the, uh, the hassle that the law schools put you through --n402c08, because i never did want --n402c27 to be a practicing attorney.###i just wanted a law degree.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i've since discovered that i would be far better off --n402e38 being in the paralegal field. because that's the nuts and bolts of the law, and that's what i like --n402e9b,###.###yeah.###.	###.###right.###.
24196:14	###.###yeah,### it's, it's actually turning out --n4036a9 to be more, more useful than what i thought --n4036d8.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um, i also have a good languages background, linguistics. and some psychology.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah.###.
24224:63	###.###no way.###.###well.###.### maybe, maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing,###but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing.###.###oh, so you are a disgruntled graduate student.###.	###.###oh.###.
24248:51	### i, i, i think,###yeah,###there is,### i, i, i think, uh, law would be a fine field, a fine profession, fine field to go into --n40451a.###um, i know one time i was in a political science class,###and you know, talking about fields, people going into different fields, i made an off, off the cuff remark about lawyers, about their integrity being questionable.###.###.###and i mean, oh, that was like a can of worms.###.	###.###no,###there was a woman,
24252:52	###um, i know one time i was in a political science class,###and you know, talking about fields, people going into different fields, i made an off, off the cuff remark about lawyers, about their integrity being questionable.###.###.###and i mean, oh, that was like a can of worms.###.### probably, you probably got everybody on you, because they were probably all going to law school.###.###no,###there was a woman,	###and it was just.###.###well, that remark in itself is a slam.
24295:15	### she's studying, she's going into law,###another friend going into law,###and, she's,### i, i, i'm really, i'm really concerned about, you know,###she's just going --n405541 to be, you know,###what's --n4055e1 going --n4055ec to happen when she gets there --n40560b.###.###yeah,###you going,###.	###.###oh, yeah.###yeah,
24454:96	###you just came to the point where i mean,###and oh, i eventually worked in a lab, in a la-, as a lab technician,###and i worked front desk.###and i mean, somebody could walk in the door,###and i knew exactly what they were going --n408594 to do --n4085a3 and say --n4085b2.###.###yeah,###yeah###i was the same way too.###i'm not a people person.	###.###yeah.###.
24504:167	###well, how do you, how do you feel --n400a17 about, uh, companies drug testing prior to --n400a42 hiring.###.###oh, uh, i was tested --n400b57, uh, within my company.###i think it's kind of a push to, uh, weed out drugs in states### and, because i don't know of any other countries that --n400d10 are doing this###.###uh-huh.###.###and i, i feel like it's really just within the united states.### it's, uh, it's okay.	###.###uh-huh.###.
24543:23	###.###yeah.###.###.###well, i ha-, i know that, for instance, in the n c double a, they drug test###and it's not random.###.###oh, i see.### how'd, how did they, how do they pick their people --n40206c.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
24615:7	###and the company i work for --n403bd1 is sixty thousand people, plus.###so see i, for some reason, i've come up three times.###that's pretty high statistics.###.###well, does your r-, does your job require you to drive company equipment or to ap-, operate any type of machinery that --n403e0b might endanger someone.###.###no.###.###.###no,	###.###well, that doesn't,###i mean i...
24669:5	###but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly reg-, uh, just across the board.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###and are they tested --n40534d random.###.###no,###they're,	###.###they're...###.
24738:37	###bye.###.###.### it's, it's hard topic because### is, is, is it doing a good job or a bad job###and you got --n40018f to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do.###.###yeah,###and are you talking about public schools being lower level, high school level or state school.###.	###.###.###okay,
24952:30	###people are going, whoa.###.###yeah.###.###so,###.### starts --n4065cc hitting closer to home.###.###yeah,###but i always,	###this,###like a couple other topics we had talked about --n40676f was crime.### it, it's, it's all money based. and what you can do --n406852 unless you just get down to the parent level
24955:40	###.###so,###.### starts --n4065cc hitting closer to home.###.###yeah,###but i always,###see it's all, it's all money.###this,###like a couple other topics we had talked about --n40676f was crime.	### and, and then if you're in a bad situation where you have --n4069e2 to send your child to a bad school --n406a09.###who --n406b12 knows,###bu-,
24974:47	###and the only school you could go to --n406e6e was the baptist school or the catholic school###so,###.###yeah,###they're a lot more strict.###.###yeah###i don't,###.###you, uh, have --n40701d to learn,	###.###yeah,###i don't know if i would do that to my child, though.
25012:8	###you get people out of high schools and col-, junior colleges that --n40804a don't have the background for an m i t kind of curriculum.###so,###.###so you have --n4081be to go to a lesser engineering school.###we have a very good public school up here###and a degree out there means a lot.###it's a very good school.### it's, it's university of vermont.###uh, we also have some two year college.###well, there's a four year colleges.	###but, like you say, you,###.###.
25109:63	###my husband is,###but, i mean, a lot of people are flat not educated###and if i have a hard time, you know --n40243d putting that into my life, can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that --n402494 doesn't have any college###.###really.###.###or i don't know how much of the you know,###.###yeah.###.	###.###absolutely.###.
25149:142	###.### and, and that's acceptable.###.###yeah,###i think it failed, too, because like what you said --n403344 of just,###you know, hey this is ridiculous.###the thing americans have so much stress on them right now.###.###yeah.###.	###.###really.###.
25218:10	###.###.###and that's what i think we ought --n404810 to do --n40481f with the metric system.###.###that's funny.###well, that's good.###i think we kept it at real good.###.###okay.###.	###.###yeah.###it --n404ae3's been nice talking to you.
25264:13	###.###i think that's true.### the, uh, the bermuda grass is greening up in march, and sometimes doesn't really start --n400251 doing that until the first part of april.### so. so i think we're a little hea-, ahead of schedule on that.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon,	###and i thought, ooh,###we've got --n40060d to start this mowing bit soon.###.
25323:100	###but you're probably right.###.###yeah.###.###well, i like it when it's sort of a medium temperature, uh, maybe seventy-five to eighty, somewhere in there --n4017b4.###i don't like it when it's too cool or too warm --n4018cb.###i'm much more apt --n401971 to get things done --n401988 when it's at that sort of in between temperature --n4019b7.###.###yeah,###that's true.	###.###um.###.
25441:45	###and then i went out two weeks ago with the guys here.###i work at t i.###.###yeah.###.###and i played in a tournament out there,###and i shot a net fifty-nine.###they were kind of, little upset.###.###.	###.###yeah,###yeah.
25643:23	###sure, come on out, you know,###and they don't mind if you make a mistake,###they don't mind --n404cfb saying, well, you know, let me tea-, tell you how to do that --n404d4e or teach you how to do that --n404d75, or,###.###well.###.###you know, it's, it's pretty nice and friendly out there###.### that, that's, that's so.###.	###.###yeah,###that's absolutely right,
25746:62	###like bowling, you know, you feel bad if you bowl a hundred.###but if you shoot a hundred in golf, you know,###you don't have --n40743f to be an expert --n407456 to play,###.###that's right.###.###any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one --n407556 and learn how to do it --n407579 and do it right.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###that's right,###well, yeah,
25755:27	###.###so, you know, you don't have --n4076d4 to be an expert in any aspect of it at all.###.###that's right,###well, yeah,### i've, i've kind of formed the attitude that, you know, if i could just, if i could pick two or three shots out, uh, out of my game every time and put them together on one hole, then i do pretty good###.###yeah.###.### and then, and i keep, i keep --n407b71 rationalizing that well, you know, i can do it,	### and, and then it will get better,###and you just keep --n407e3e going,###and in the meantime, just enjoy what you're doing --n407ec2.
25829:39	###i mean i had a delightful evening one night --n4001a6 cutting a bunch of those suckers up.###.###um, i wish i had.###.###well, you should try it.###.###well, i,###it was done --n400389 for me after a while.### i had a, uh, i had a business going.###and this was back in the eighties.	###but, uh, i had a coin shop,###and everything was going great while gold and silver was up,###and it started --n4006e5 falling.

25873:78	###yeah.###i was buying from other dealers,###and, uh, you know, they take payment any way they can get it --n400e94.###.###oh, that's a nightmare.###.###yeah.###course on, on stuff that i was, on merchandise that i was buying --n401013 on cards, it was, i was getting the money back,###because i was selling it.###i wasn't buying, you know, just --n401240 to hold onto it.	###.###uh-huh.###.
25880:44	###course on, on stuff that i was, on merchandise that i was buying --n401013 on cards, it was, i was getting the money back,###because i was selling it.###i wasn't buying, you know, just --n401240 to hold onto it.###uh, but it was things like, you know, rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that --n401348 ate them all up.###.###uh-huh.###.###so.###.###well, i remember before i got married --n4014a5,	###.###uh-huh.###.
25887:20	###so.###.###well, i remember before i got married --n4014a5,###you know when you graduate from college --n40153b they'll send you all those credit card applications you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###sure.###.
25893:34	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###of course you fill them all out because you're honored --n401698.###.###sure.###.###and, uh, i had stuff for like sanger harris,###and, you know, it got up like to couple of hundred dollars,	###.###uh-huh.###.

26050:14	###.###well, and you're tempted --n4040b5 if you've got cash, a little bit of cash, and you don't have enough for the purchase, right.###.###yeah.###.###of course, you got --n40424f to charge it and keep your cash.###.###sure,###naturally.###that's,	###.###what are you saying --n404407.###oh, my husband says i might buy it,
26118:50	### circuit, circuit world or something.###.###circuit city.###.###circuit city.###have you been in there.###.###yeah,### they, they're not, their prices aren't that terrific.### they, they used --n4053ba to be,	###.###oh, it's national.###.
26127:29	### they, they used --n4053ba to be,###but they've gotten, they've got --n405469 to pay for all that national advertising now.###.###oh, it's national.###.###uh-huh.###.###i think i've seen two around dallas.###.###yeah,	###.###well, what else,###.
26148:67	###yeah,###in garland.###.###you got service merchandise.###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah,###it used --n405b00 to be service merchandise was the place to go --n405b37.###and, uh, circuit city came along	###and then after the years went by, they just sort of kept --n405dbe creeping up on price,###and actually service merchandise is cheaper than them now.###so.
26354:92	###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, i loved it,###i really did.###but, uh, um, i finally decided --n400fa0 to go --n400faf check out what the, uh, what the, uh, foreign cars were --n400ff2.###so i bought myself a, a, a nissan a two forty s x.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
26497:28	###.###but to pay that much money for an automobile, uh, is just,### i can't, i can't conceive of --n404c76 doing that.###.###yeah,###that's, uh,###i went to a, a car show down here about, uh, about two weeks ago,###and, um, you know, of course they had the normal, the ford, the, the chevrolet, that stuff.###but then you started --n404ff1 looking at the, uh, uh,###they had ferrari there,	###and ferrari didn't even let you near the car,###i mean, they were,###that's how expensive they were --n40527a.
26587:15	###.###all right.###.###um, i, i understand that it --n400079's being proposed --n40008c as a requirement, for, uh, young people to be, to go into public service.###.###uh-huh.###.###i think,###.###yes,	###they did not specify, you know, exactly what young means --n400312.###.###yeah,
26668:67	###i'm not either really.###.###but, you know, if, a, a lot of people flat can't afford --n40199b to.###.###that's right.###.###you know,###.###that's right.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
26811:13	###.###yeah.###.###they wouldn't have --n404498 to spend money --n4044ab advertising and things like that.###.###yeah.###that's right.###.###you go to school###and you have a kind of a captive audience,	###.###yeah.###.
26899:34	###well, we have a little bit of a basis for conversation.###.###mumblex.###.###i was a substitute teacher for about a year.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah.###i, uh, thought i wanted --n4004e6 to be a teacher	###.###uh-huh.###.
26907:16	###yeah.###i, uh, thought i wanted --n4004e6 to be a teacher### so, but before i went through all of that i wanted --n4005a8 to see how i was going --n4005c7 to like it --n4005da.###.###uh-huh.###.### and, and they, uh,###in alabama, where i came from --n4007a3 they, they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree.###so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided, nope, not for me.###.	###or,###.###yeah.
26907:26	###yeah.###i, uh, thought i wanted --n4004e6 to be a teacher### so, but before i went through all of that i wanted --n4005a8 to see how i was going --n4005c7 to like it --n4005da.###.###uh-huh.###.### and, and they, uh,###in alabama, where i came from --n4007a3 they, they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree.###so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided, nope, not for me.###.	###or,###.###yeah.
26977:24	###but i don't think they could cover everything that you could teach, your children --n401e14 on an individual basis.###.### exact-, exactly,###.###.###and too, most people don't have that option.###.###yeah.###.###you know. and plus it also depends on the district you're in --n40201a as, i mean, on the,	###it doesn't matter what you do --n4021f3.###uh, accept for the private ones, of course,###we're talking about public.
27085:51	###but i think there does need --n404aec to be a reemphasis of those because, of our, our lower grades in the standardized test and such.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###oh, sure.###i mean, i-, i-, it --n404cf1's indicative across the board that we, we've done something wrong.###.###right.###.	###and, you know, here we are --n40501e### we can't, we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator.###.
27085:69	###but i think there does need --n404aec to be a reemphasis of those because, of our, our lower grades in the standardized test and such.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###oh, sure.###i mean, i-, i-, it --n404cf1's indicative across the board that we, we've done something wrong.###.###right.###.	###and, you know, here we are --n40501e### we can't, we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator.###.
27085:80	###but i think there does need --n404aec to be a reemphasis of those because, of our, our lower grades in the standardized test and such.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###oh, sure.###i mean, i-, i-, it --n404cf1's indicative across the board that we, we've done something wrong.###.###right.###.	###and, you know, here we are --n40501e### we can't, we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator.###.
27133:32	###.###oh.###.###and, uh, i did the same sort of thing,###they just,###you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases###and then you get one examine for the whole semester###.###uh-huh.###.	###.### how, how much can you stuff --n405c0e in your brain.###.
27350:15	###.###and then, um,###.###.###hi.###.###hi, uh,###as a matter of fact this past weekend, since we had a long weekend, i, uh, took on a painting project in my bathroom###and i had wallpaper up,###i had --n4001f8 to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that	###because, uh, the wallpaper, --n400340 getting it off, i had --n40035f to wet the walls down###and that had --n40042e to dry.###and then the spackling had --n40049a to dry a day
27449:7	### have you, have you tried --n4023ad getting outside estimates --n4023c0 to see what it --n4023d7 costs --n4023e2 to have something painted --n4023fd.###.###not inside.###now, uh, when we bought the house that we live in --n402583 right now --n402592 we had a company that --n4025ad came out and painted it.###that was one of the requirements from, you know, f h a that the house be painted --n402735 before we bought it###.###yeah.###.###and it was fairly reasonable.###we have a brick house	###.###yeah.###.
27521:25	### and, uh, but they didn't, --n403aa2 didn't occur to them that, um, that they could have taken a sample um, from,###.###uh-huh.###.###i forgotten,###this is sherwin williams paint or something###but anyway. it's, it's remarkable.###that's one of the problems though when you start --n403dbe painting --n403dc9 to try --n403ddc to get the, you know,### you want this, you want this to look like this###and you want that to look like that	###.###uh-huh.###.
27521:37	### and, uh, but they didn't, --n403aa2 didn't occur to them that, um, that they could have taken a sample um, from,###.###uh-huh.###.###i forgotten,###this is sherwin williams paint or something###but anyway. it's, it's remarkable.###that's one of the problems though when you start --n403dbe painting --n403dc9 to try --n403ddc to get the, you know,### you want this, you want this to look like this###and you want that to look like that	###.###uh-huh.###.
27573:12	###because it, uh, it seems like everybody has a, you know, --n404aaa to go in and do,###i'll just do a little bit here and a little there.###.###yeah.###.###although, the, uh,### it's uh, it,###we almost one day,###we painted the house to, uh,### we painted, we painted the whole inside	###we thought, uh, you know,###we did the one wall###but the other trim, i'm trying --n404fc7 to think, i think, i think we left most of it because it gets --n405012 to be, uh,
27629:16	###okay.###.### the, the molding###.###white.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###but by,	###.###yeah.###.
27643:49	###but it makes the room look smaller which --n405ed2 is, uh uh, which --n405ef1 is,###.###yeah.###.###.###it explains why they, why they have everything white --n40601b###but i, you wouldn't think that i,###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah.###.
27789:104	###and i never have the discipline --n4025df to stay with it,###but when i do play, uh, and begin --n40268e to reacquire skills --n4026a1 i inevitably fall in love with country western music which --n4026d0 tends --n4026db to be in some ways easy to play --n40270a for a, for a new piano player.###.### it is, it's got, uh, basically an easy, uh, rhythm and, and tone.###.###right.###.###and it's, it's pretty, fairly well easily to uh, uh, something to fall into --n402ab9.###i'm kind of the say way,### i, i've gone through different periods of life, uh, in music from pop to classical.	###i was influenced --n40304e by all different kinds of music but basically because that's where i worked --n40308d.###and i've developed a real love for, uh, classical music in, probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was, uh, heavy into classical type music.###he said he used --n4032f4 to sit on saturday mornings and watch cartoons just --n40331f to hear the music, uh, that they were using --n403352 behind them because they used, especially disney used --n40337d a lot of classical music, uh, behind the cartoons
27790:20	###but when i do play, uh, and begin --n40268e to reacquire skills --n4026a1 i inevitably fall in love with country western music which --n4026d0 tends --n4026db to be in some ways easy to play --n40270a for a, for a new piano player.###.### it is, it's got, uh, basically an easy, uh, rhythm and, and tone.###.###right.###.###and it's, it's pretty, fairly well easily to uh, uh, something to fall into --n402ab9.###i'm kind of the say way,### i, i've gone through different periods of life, uh, in music from pop to classical.###i guess one of the things was that --n402db6 influenced me was that i, i've worked in radio stations as a d j for all my college years --n402e11 trying --n402e1c to support my way through there, and suppor-, was support,	###and i've developed a real love for, uh, classical music in, probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was, uh, heavy into classical type music.###he said he used --n4032f4 to sit on saturday mornings and watch cartoons just --n40331f to hear the music, uh, that they were using --n403352 behind them because they used, especially disney used --n40337d a lot of classical music, uh, behind the cartoons###and so consequently we wind up, wound up --n403599 playing a lot of classical music there
27841:10	### i, i, uh, spent my junior year, uh, and sophomore and junior year in, in college when i,###a song by the, uh, uh,###i think the title of it was just downtown,###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, and if you recall how it goes downtown, ta, da, da, da --n404b2f,###.###right.###.	###and i get strongly evoked memories of, of difficult times in school being behind on work,###.###uh-huh.
27887:37	###.###yeah.###.###and i,###keys and things are something --n405ba8 to me that --n405bbb remain a mystery no matter how many times i bang --n405bea on them.###i have a pretty good mathematical concept for what --n405cff's involved,###.###right.###.###uh, but in a, in a innate music sense there just seems --n405ddf to be something missing there which --n405e02 is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math aptitude	### but, but it doesn't for me.###.###.
27893:41	###.###right.###.###uh, but in a, in a innate music sense there just seems --n405ddf to be something missing there which --n405e02 is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math aptitude###and i keep --n405f9b thinking, gee, i thought that all the math and music people are supposed --n405fde to go hand in hand### but, but it doesn't for me.###.###.###no,###it's making that, that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it.	###in fact my brother and sister both, they were, oh, thirteen, sixteen years older than i,###they went through the, uh, parent thing where you've got --n406447 to practice or you're not going out --n40646e to play --n40647d thing,###.
27970:54	### if you had, if you were a teacher. then, you know, that was it, until the kids were little.###.###yeah,### you, you weren't supposed --n400b10 to want a job.###.###yes.### there was not, there's not supposed --n400bec to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have --n400c37 for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be --n400c82 on any given day --n400c99.###.###yeah.###.	###you're supposed --n400fad to only want the job,### and, and, uh, your kids should be totally happy in day care, because everybody else goes to day care###.
28170:40	###conv-,###yeah,###just,###yeah,###con,###.###.###yeah,###well.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
28213:82	###.###and that's a very hard attitude to change --n406ff9.###.###yeah,### and without, and, and it's just they don't look at things.###most of the men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes, you probably ought --n40720c to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it.###.###uh-huh.###.###they just, you know, just scoot it on another spot on the sink and put the next plate down, and in a while get around to it.	###.###yeah,###uh-huh,
28359:33	###yeah.###speakeranan*t3-1.###speakera3-2*t3-2.###you and me both.###speakerbnan*t3-2.###.###it seems everything i do --n40014d is computer related.###.###huh-uh.###.	###.###speakerb7-1*t7-1.###and so i like the i b m p c, personally.
28399:7	###.###huh-uh.###.###i also use my p c --n4009fc to emulate a mainframe terminal for our i b m mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine.###.###huh-uh.###.###.###oh, okay.###.	###but i'm, i'm getting, not only our local area network,###but i'm getting two separate mainframe machines, also.###.
28531:74	###we had a printer, a hewlett packard ready writer.###.###huh-uh.###.###and we had about ten people sharing this printer by,###it was attached --n403794 to like a central p c###and you had --n403813 to take your diskette to the p c --n40383a to print something.###.###um, now that's awful.###.	###so i talked my boss into --n403b8f investing in a,###it's not a, uh, a uh, real elaborate local area network,###.

28620:13	###.###so they just want black and white, which mumblex see we can just run --n405264 them through the laser printer real quick. because it --n405293 will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, it, uh,###.	###you don't need them in four colors.###.###no,
28750:19	###.###thirty-eight.###.###oh, well then you should###see over thirty-five everything goes downhill flop.###.###well, the rest of me is in pretty good shape###it's just that left knee that --n400898 just doesn't want --n4008af to do everything it used --n4008ce to --n4008dd.###.###oh, you're lucky then	###.###really.###.

29126:59	###so i'm not, i'm more opinionated --n4012ef about the observations than, than the true facts,###but, it --n401402's just a shame to me that, that the, our firemen, our policemen, and school teachers are the three least paid utilities, um, that --n40148d have the biggest impact to our well-being.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###that's true.###.### i have, i have a real issue with that.###um, i think that if from every year when they, when they pull in the, the, the, uh, test that the last three years, you know, ten, eleven, twelve year, uh, graders take --n401813 --n40181a,	###they're not saying that something's wrong with the educational system here in texas,###i have a real concern about that, um,###as a matter of fact i'm very content to spend my daughter out of state to college in virginia, uh, verses having her go down here and not learn anything,

29818:18	###yes.###.###i've never done that,###and those are so neat.###i mean, i would really like --n403398 to do those###but, um.###.###i've seen some,###and there, there, they,###i suspect they're fairly simple, because the one lady i've seen --n403555, i know that --n403570 does it, i've never asked her any questions,	###.###.### and, and they're all a handful.
29821:25	###and those are so neat.###i mean, i would really like --n403398 to do those###but, um.###.###i've seen some,###and there, there, they,###i suspect they're fairly simple, because the one lady i've seen --n403555, i know that --n403570 does it, i've never asked her any questions,###but she has three kids all under the age of like six.###.###.	###so it's got --n403818 to be something she can do --n40383b fairly easily and fairly quickly.###.###oh, definitely,
29904:44	### and, but once i get --n4050f4 started --n4050ff, i can't put it down.###i just,###.###i have a similar problem.###i've got --n405259 to have time###or i don't even want --n4052d5 to get into it in the first place.###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###.	###.###i know,###i started a project, it's been over a year ago that i swore i was going --n405503 to finish --n405512 for somebody for christmas.
29980:39	###like i said i really enjoy it when i do --n406cfb.###it's just hard.###.###just hard finding the time that --n406ded can be dedicated --n406e00.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###and there's, there's so many other things that, i, i have done --n406f02, you know, in the meantime, like i said, so many baby gifts.###i've made a lot of bibs, and wall hangings,	###so it --n407201's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them.###.### do you, do you use patterns, i mean, like a book of patterns,
30032:21	###.###oh, okay.###.###and then, see i didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print, you know,###that was just the ink,###and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth.###that was so simple.###.###oh, that sounds really neat.###.	###.### did you do, did you use, like, uh, a stamp pad and ink.###.
30089:32	###well, we, uh, me and my wife, when, when we have like extra money that we know we're going --n400c52 to have --n400c61, and we can put it in our budget --n400c8c, yeah, we'll, we'll use it.###but like last year, i think we paid,###i think it was like twenty something cents interest, on our visa.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i think this, this year we, uh, i think --n401083 we used it for christmas,###and we got caught --n4011ab just a few days on our grace period.### and, uh, so we'll pay a little interest --n401262 this year, but maybe two dollars.	###.###yes.###.
30226:56	###so there's a little consternation, you know, in trying --n403ef9 to get them to compensate, for the difference in the exchange rate.###.###yeah.###.###.###right.###yeah###especially,###.###that was the only time i really got caught --n4040b5 short --n4040c0.	###.###yeah.###.
30469:28	###.###and he goes in and prin-, and types his checks on the screen and then hits print,###and they print out on the checks,###and he's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places you know,###.###oh my gosh.###.###and he just whips, out, you know,###i saw him yesterday morning over there,### and, and he paid his monthly bills,	###and it printed out like ten checks,###and he just, you know,###they're perforated,
30480:74	###and it printed out like ten checks,###and he just, you know,###they're perforated,###and he just ripped them off.###they go through just a continuous thing on the printer###.###right.###.###and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes###and there they went.	###.###right.###.
30486:52	###right.###.###and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes###and there they went.###you know, and he said, you know, i can balance my checkbook in seconds, you know because it's all in the computer, you know.###.###right.###.###so.###.	###.###that's exactly why.### he said, you know, he said, used --n403209 to be i always sat --n403228 looking for those, you know.
30580:26	###and then he went on and got his master's degree while i was working.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i'm the better typist, of us,###.###uh-huh.###.###and we just had a regular old typewriter, not even a correcting one back then.###.	###.###it wasn't that long ago,###but i typed his master's papers and things on a typewriter.
30648:133	###speakerb109-2*t109-2.### use it as a, just a,###speakeranan*t109-2.###.###yeah,###instead of knowing what they want --n40641f to say --n40642e before they eve-, they just, you know, play with it, and, which in a way --n406491 is nice to be able to do --n4064c0,###.###right.###.###but, you know, it, it gets a little out of hand sometimes.	###.###oh yeah.###.
30673:85	###and it's like, you know, it's ridiculous###and that was, that was the high week,###but it's running about seventy which --n407238 is still ridiculous to have --n407257 to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types --n40728a.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###well, it --n4073e1's good that she does that, i mean, bring it to people's attention.###.###well, that's exactly right.	###you know, this is ridiculous###and you know, --n40785c changing, add this time to now.###.
30707:53	###.###oh, i do too,###i do too.###the on line encyclopedia just sounds wonderful,###you know, that sounds like such a great idea,###you know, it --n40864a'd be kind of fun to be able --n408675 to play with it.###so. i know, my father had a p c,###and when we were in high school --n40880f it was always fun.###we could, um, link in,###and i don't even remember now what it was called --n408933 --n40893a.	###.###uh-huh.###.
30736:93	###that still could add up.###.###oh it added up --n40928a big.###well, you know, we, my parents were divorced --n409310###and so the time we were like visiting our father in the summer time --n4093e0, you know,###so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it.###.###yeah.###.###i'm sure we would not have been allowed --n40959c to do that under normal situations, you know.	###.###.###that's sad.
30775:10	###.### do, do you have kids you take --n400246 to movies###or,###.###no,###no kids.###.###yeah.###it's a walt disney movie###and it didn't get as, you know, as good a reviews as like the little mermaid, their last one,	###but this one was, i thought was excellent.###the mumblex,###.
30791:40	###yeah,###it's animated.###and i can't believe how good they're getting --n4006fd with their animation now.###it's just, just the special effects, you know.###and in this movie, this, there's this boy###and he rescues this, uh, bald eagle### and, uh, and it's a huge eagle, you know, wing span of twenty feet or something like that.###and the boy actually rides on his back###and he rides through the clouds, you know,###and you see him coming out of the clouds, his head coming out and then the bird coming out,	###and i mean, i know they, there must have used, been computers or something for animation this day,###but it was just so real, realistic and lifelike and good animation.###it was a good show.
30849:21	###.###superstar.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###but chuck norris, of course, could be just about equal, if not more###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###hum.###.
30894:58	###yeah.###yeah,###they show up at the dollar movie right after they get, come out.###you know they're usually not, not that great or didn't do that great anyway.###.###a lot of,###.### let me see.### let me see###another movie i watched --n402e28.	###.###uh-huh.###.
30905:26	###.###uh-huh.###.###i haven't seen that.###have you seen that one yet.###.###yeah.###.### what, what, what,###.	###uh, i guess what --n40321e made it so good was the cinema-, cinematography,###.### the, the wide open, the spaces,
31001:14	###.###i always wait for the movie.###i don't have time --n404757 to read the book --n40476e.###.###yeah.###i don't,###i read about one or two thick novels like that a year. you know,###.###uh-huh.###.	###but that was a good show i thought --n404a3d, you know.###i read about how they did, uh, an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine --n404b2a.###you know, that --n404c23 wasn't a real submarine you saw --n404c4a in the water.
31003:53	###i don't have time --n404757 to read the book --n40476e.###.###yeah.###i don't,###i read about one or two thick novels like that a year. you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###that's about all the time i can, i can spare --n40495a.###but that was a good show i thought --n404a3d, you know.	###you know, that --n404c23 wasn't a real submarine you saw --n404c4a in the water.### it was, it was all done --n404d25 in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the hollywood magic.###.
31005:28	###yeah.###i don't,###i read about one or two thick novels like that a year. you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###that's about all the time i can, i can spare --n40495a.###but that was a good show i thought --n404a3d, you know.###i read about how they did, uh, an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine --n404b2a.###you know, that --n404c23 wasn't a real submarine you saw --n404c4a in the water.	###.###yeah.###.

31041:13	###but it, it's f slash x.###.###huh. what's that about --n405431.###.###a, uh, special effects man who somehow --n4054a8 gets involved --n4054b7 in this, um,###oh, i'm not sure.###i can't remember.###it's been a while since i've seen it.###but he, he gets involved --n4056a9 in some sort of bad dealings with somebody###and he has --n40577e to go underground,	###.###hm.###.
31051:29	###and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in --n40580b doing what --n40581a needs --n405825 to be done --n405838.###.###hm.###.###and, uh,###.### to, to fool people###and mumblex,###.###right,	###.###all the tricks.###.
31067:32	###that sounds like an interesting concept.###.###but you need --n405c13 to rent the first one first.###.### to understand what --n405ca3's going on in the second.###.###uh, if, if that is that the second one follows the first.###i don't know if they have the, uh, original actors on that first one to that one.###.###uh-huh.	###.###oh.###.
31151:11	###.###okay.###bye-bye.###.###adios.###.###.###okay.###well,###.	###but they're not in public school yet.### i, i get, i get that experience starting next fall with kindergarten.###.
31251:71	###and i wonder, how do they handle a child who --n402bed is obviously very ready and another child who --n402c14 doesn't even speak english, let alone know her colors --n402c47.###.###yeah.###.###and they're in the same classrooms.###and i guess also you're going --n402e1a to see the first of the, uh, crack kids starting kindergarten.###my god, i think it would be next year is what i'd read --n402f62.###i thought, well, how do you, how do you weed those out --n403057.###.###yes.	###.###.###and i would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases.
31353:29	###yeah.###it --n4063e9's pretty sad to think, uh, about those who, even today, --n406430 are graduating from school###and they are telling that they don't know how to read --n406550, you know.###.###well, my stepson, you know, i, he went into the navy or air force.###i just really get my military,###i married into a military family,###.###.###and i don't know,	###so i don't offend anybody.###.###.
31365:42	###.###.###but, uh, you know, fortunately for him, he wasn't dumb###but boy he sure had trouble, you know, putting things on, on paper.###.###yeah.###.###and one of the things that, that they did --n406b05 for him. they tested him###and they said that he's, you know, great in electronics###but he, you know, he's, really does need the basic skills.	###and at that point, he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors.###.###oh.

33205:65	###.###just um the crawfish i mean it just has a taste of its own###it also depends on who --n4032d3's cooking it and how much seasoning they use --n4032fe stuff like that###.###sure###.###but um i think that###and also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps###.###yeah.	###.###.###and
33271:108	###sometimes it might be the candlelight###and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something###.###that's right###.###.###well that's you know that's fun###.###.###it was fun	###.###uh huh###.
33271:127	###sometimes it might be the candlelight###and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something###.###that's right###.###.###well that's you know that's fun###.###.###it was fun	###.###uh huh###.
33374:28	###and then the sauce is just made --n40619f with um bouillion cubes water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour###.###um-hum###.###.###oh###.###so it's not a it's not a thick rich type of a sauce###it's more of a###when you use corn starch in in gravy --n4063fa like you know when you have um chinese food --n406425 that kind of a gravy or a sauce that --n406450 comes with a lot of that	###.###um-hum###.
33382:87	###it's more of a###when you use corn starch in in gravy --n4063fa like you know when you have um chinese food --n406425 that kind of a gravy or a sauce that --n406450 comes with a lot of that###they use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies###.###um-hum###.###and it gives it a bit of a different consistency###.###well um how long do you cook the meatballs --n406755###.	###.###uh huh###.
33386:17	###um-hum###.###and it gives it a bit of a different consistency###.###well um how long do you cook the meatballs --n406755###.###the meatballs you just um after you form them fry them in a pan until they're uh browned on all all sides###.###uh huh###.	###uh then what i usually do --n4069dc is i freeze them###and then when you're ready --n406a8c to serve them --n406a9f then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce and heat it###.
33450:35	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###so i'm going to have you know my whole job's going --n407a88 to be based on my clients'n stuff like that###so i'm going --n407be1 to have lots of dinner parties###.###sure.###.###and have --n407c95 to take'em out --n407cac to eat	###.###oh###.
33496:44	###.###i ripped the ligaments in my right ankle.###.###gosh.###.###yeah###so,###.###exercise is not supposed --n400243 to do that to you.###.	###do you do anything on a regular basis.###.###well, off and on,
33702:38	###.###oh, goodness.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###i can't do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt.###.###oh, that makes sense.###so, i mean, are you, in terms of other things, like, like, not running, but playing a little bit of tennis,	###.###uh, well i haven't tried that.###i don't know.
33739:4	###and, you know, i'm not heavy,###but when you go easy --n40494a a hundred seventy at my height, um, i'm five eleven you need just take it easy.###.###um.###.###.###sure.###.###um, but when i see some wo-,###i mean, and i just don't think it's healthy	###.### it isn't, really, it's not really good for your knees.###.
33739:11	###and, you know, i'm not heavy,###but when you go easy --n40494a a hundred seventy at my height, um, i'm five eleven you need just take it easy.###.###um.###.###.###sure.###.###um, but when i see some wo-,###i mean, and i just don't think it's healthy	###.### it isn't, really, it's not really good for your knees.###.
33797:31	###yeah.###.###if i don't do it i just feel like i don't have as much energy.###.###uh-huh.###and it's real funny because if you, you know,###it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy --n405b9e that you'd be tired,###but it's the other way around.###.###right.	###.###yeah###really.
33809:13	###yeah###really.###.###yeah###but,###.###speakera112-1*t112-1.###yeah,###speakerbnan*t112-1.###speakerb112-2*t112-2.	###speakeranan*t112-2.###.###that gravity factor,
33843:11	###i'm not heavy, you know,###maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being.###.###uh-huh.###.###i said, uh, why do i feel like i need --n4065ac to start --n4065bb pushing myself more --n4065ce.###and he goes, human nature.###.###.###and then, you know, you see these little girls in these little bitty things,	###.###uh-huh.###.
33896:14	###yeah,###that's true.###and i haven't noticed that up at spring creek.###.###no,###i haven't either,###and i just, uh,###it's not that far of a drive###and i'm glad they did that.###um, you're not missing anything at the dallas renovated site.	###.###yeah.###.
33913:11	###.###yeah,###but if you don't live near there that's not worth,###.###yeah.###i live in richardson,###but it's about half way between the spring creek and the, the dallas site.###.###yeah.###that's actually where this happened to me, out in, i say --n407bb2 plano --n407bbd,	###richardson, over on campbell and park hill there's a new recreation center.###.###uh-huh.
33918:46	###i live in richardson,###but it's about half way between the spring creek and the, the dallas site.###.###yeah.###that's actually where this happened to me, out in, i say --n407bb2 plano --n407bbd,###but it's all the same to me.###richardson, over on campbell and park hill there's a new recreation center.###.###uh-huh.###.	###mumblex walked out,###i was one thing,###oh great, i have purple tights on, you know.
34079:72	###.###no.###no.###.###because if, if you're going --n402176 to go --n402185 buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, i think you, you're going --n4021d8 to have some idea as to what you're going --n402207 to do --n402216 with it.###you're not going --n402437 to react that quickly.###in other words, you know, you don't have a need to go --n4024ec buy a gun --n4024ff to go --n40250e shoot it the next day.###.###th-,###somebody wants --n40265b to do that,	###.###yeah.###i do too. uh, because it --n402857 doesn't make any difference, uh, uh, whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, i suppose --n4028b6.
34166:40	###plus you have --n404381 to pay for the, the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in --n4043c4.###.###yeah.###well, that's what my husband,###when he was in that gun club where he was doing that --n40456f --n404576.###it, you know,###he went mostly --n404681 just to, uh, shoot at paper targets.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###i think that, that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose.###in fact, i'd like --n4048d0 to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon --n404917 you have to, uh, show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon --n40498e.
34254:45	###.###and, uh, i don't know why i never registered it --n4067b0###but the, uh,###.###i don't think you have --n406890 to register a shotgun.###.###um, i, i think it's, it's voluntary.### the, uh, the,###.###well, see, uh, my husband has a thing.	###.###yeah.###.
34290:10	###.###and, that's true.###.###uh, i,### bu-, bu-, you know, they know so, how much money --n4074e6 you make --n4074f5 a week to, uh, probably your, uh,###my kid is banging.###i was seeing what they was banging on --n40769b.###uh, i've lost my train of thought.###i'm sorry.###.	### you, you were talking about, uh, uh, fed-, what --n407853 the federal government knows --n40786a about people.###.###oh, the soc-,
34351:16	###it comes out every tuesday.###.###and there's, there's no waiting period on that.###.###no.###none whatsoever.###.###.###you call,###we sold a refrigerator through it	###.### to sell the refrigerator.###.
34450:36	###.###in fact, people i've talked to --n400e20 said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards.###so,###.###really.###oh, i love them like that.###.###yeah.###.###i'm not,	###but i like that where they run --n401101 tense --n40110c.###.###uh-huh.
34499:16	###right,###right.###and i was impressed with the fact that, um, it wasn't that childish.###.###yeah.###.###you know what i mean --n401c9a.###it wasn't,###my daughter's five,###i mean she understood everything.	###and she really enjoyed it,###but it was on a higher level, you know, where there were some things that kids didn't understand --n401f4b that adults did --n401f5e --n401f65,###and i liked that.
34592:26	###oh yeah,###because, i mean, everybody grows up --n403af0 looking at these cop movies and trying --n403b13 to, you know, to imitate them or whatever.###.###right.###.###and, uh, i thought he did such an excellent job of not going that far.###.###yeah,###.###now, by the end he was looking more like a cop.	###.###right.###.
34695:54	###i mean, it's amazing###.###i do too.###.###i love those movies###.###i do too.###.###i really do.###.	###.###yeah.###.
34717:10	###.###oh, isn't it though.###you know, but that's at least the good thing about the texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper.###.###but normally we don't think about it until,###.###that's exactly what, i was going --n406076 to say --n406085.###.###.###i keep --n40611f not doing it until after i'm there	###.###i know, because we --n4062bf can go --n4062ce spend fifteen dollars --n4062e1 just getting in the three of us.###.
34796:9	###i would,###i mean, i guess my first instinct was --n40727f to wait for the video, too.###but i'm glad i didn't.###i really and truly am.###i mean, that mov-, that was one movie i came out --n40745f impressed --n40746a.###.###uh-huh.###.###i really and truly did.###i mean, i have absolutely no problems with them winning seven oscars.	###.###right.###.
34800:69	###i mean, that mov-, that was one movie i came out --n40745f impressed --n40746a.###.###uh-huh.###.###i really and truly did.###i mean, i have absolutely no problems with them winning seven oscars.###none at all.###.###right.###.	###.###everythin-,###yeah,
34819:43	###yeah, oh.###.###like i said, i wouldn't given the supporting actresses either one.###.###yeah.###.###but even though they were okay, the girl in it,###they,###somebody made an interesting observation,###now that i think back on it, i'd say yeah, i can't believe that either.	###you know what i mean --n407d24, you know.###.###.
34823:21	###yeah.###.###but even though they were okay, the girl in it,###they,###somebody made an interesting observation,###now that i think back on it, i'd say yeah, i can't believe that either.###she was the only indian --n407c4f to have her hair done at all times.###you know what i mean --n407d24, you know.###.###.	###.###yeah.###.
34992:8	###.###so, yeah,### i, i used --n400cc3 to,###when my kids were real little and i was home --n400d64, i watched,###where i was home --n400e1c###where i watched things on a more regular basis --n400e83.###but right now, the last things i watched --n400f1d regularly was thirty something when it first came out --n400f48.###.###okay.###.	###.### i, yeah, i started, too, and, uh kind of, kind of worked away from that.###.
35062:10	###that's right.### i, uh, when i first moved down here, moved into the apartment and got cable --n4023d1,######and i guess i sort of, kind of became numb.###.###uh-huh.###.###nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the t v, you know.###.###.	###.###right.###.
35158:55	###stuff i guess --n404536 that --n404541 mostly public, on public t v.###.###right.###.###as a matter of fact, you know when i was a kid --n40464c, excuse me, my parents used --n404673 to have,###we had this rule --n404796 in our house for every hour of regular t v that we watched --n4047d5, we had --n4047e8 to watch an hour of public t v.###.###now there's an idea.###.###that was just the rule.	###or there was some other,###the children's program i think --n404bd0 at the time was called --n404beb what --n404bf6's new.###.
35288:23	###.###right,###right.###isn't it such a long running program.###.###yeah.###.###yeah,### they do have a good, they do have good writers for that.###oh, that makes me think,	###.###i try --n406d0e to.###.
35565:76	###.###yeah,###i just about could really because i think my car,###.###yeah.###.###if i continue --n403b23 taking good care of it, it's going --n403b4e to hold a pretty good resale value###.###oh yeah.###.	###.###yeah,### i, i would think that's true.
35595:57	###but, uh, i really, i really enjoy the car i have --n40423a now,###and i do want --n40431c to hold onto it and, and you know, enjoy it while it's not having any mechanical problems whatsoever,###.###that's right.###.###in fact it never has###.###that's right.###.###and, uh, it's been kind of nice,	###and i want --n4046c7 to hang on to it while it's still being a good car and while i'm not tired of it and while i'm single and can handle a two seater for now and get that out of my system.###.###well.
35648:5	###.###but, uh, my car is using two quarts of oil a week now.###.###oh my gosh.###.### about, about a quart every hundred miles.###.###oh, no.###.### so, but, uh, it runs fine,	###it's just very thirsty.###.###yeah.
35777:13	###is that right.###.###and they had already told me, we located one at town north.###so it was that same car.###.###my gosh.###.###yeah,###well, unless you're selling car with hail damage and flood damage, i got the car off your lot for that price.###.	###.###oh i did.###and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the two thousand mile checkup --n407e7f
35845:74	###.###bye-bye.###.###.###well, i haven't heard anything about the proposal myself,###but, uh, uh, i don't know if it's their proposal or one that --n4000f0's being seriously kicked --n400107 around.###.###no,###i haven't either.###.	###.###yeah.###.

35962:18	###exactly.###.###i mean, i've always felt that people on welfare should be required --n401daa to spend at least part of their time, not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job, but at least some of their time to look for, --n401e59 to go out and clean up the roads. you know,###.###oh yeah,### absol-, absolutely.###.###.###i mean,###.	###and if they're able-bodied people, i don't see any problem --n4023e4 at all with having them go out there and, and,###if nothing else, get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let them cut the yards, paint the houses.###.

36001:11	###.###that right.###.###yeah,###and he, he had all kinds of horror stories.###you know, these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks,###and, back, back in those days they also use --n402caa to give you, uh, booklets good for, uh, clothing and gas, and things like this.###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah.###.
36007:145	###and, back, back in those days they also use --n402caa to give you, uh, booklets good for, uh, clothing and gas, and things like this.###.###yeah.###.###they get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games you know,###.###yeah.###.###and i'm, i jus-, i have a hard time --n402f6b dealing with that.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
36138:89	###.###yeah,### and, and it can be good for them, too.###.###yeah,###oh yeah.###.###i mean, even, even the greedy kids that we've got --n4058a0 now...###.###oh god, you go to the mall	###.###i know.###.
36269:24	###and they, uh,###this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap --n4082ab,###and they were having a hard time.###and they told the strikers there, look, we need you to come back and get this stuff done --n4083e0.###or else we're going --n4084c8 to be out of business.###and they wouldn't come back,###so they went bankrupt.###.###yeah.###.	###.###sure,### and, and and that's really what --n4086d9 happened to the steel industry in this country.
36513:42	###i did that with the second baby,###and, um, i went to my exercise class one day,###and then she was delivered --n4037e3 the next day.###.###gosh.###.###so, it would seem --n403876 to be real beneficial.###.###uh-huh,###yeah.	###.###well i think it made parts of it a lot easier.### and, and is this your first that you're having --n403ac7.
36551:33	###i don't.### my, my wife has been working with them.###.###oh, okay,###well then she could go if she were interested.###.###uh-huh.###.###i think, that's what the class that --n4045da meets on saturday mornings.###so she could find out if she wanted --n4046b1 to go.	###and they would talk about exercise and just general things relating to the birthing process.###and so for us it was educational as well as exercise beneficial.###so,
36639:12	###a lot of people i know --n400b5e are,###but, um, i don't, i don't mumblex.###.### i, i don't like --n400cba really camping in the rough.###i like the, the, the little necessities like having electricity --n400da9 available and running water and showers and things like that.###.###yeah,###mumblex we went, we went once to a lean-to###and it, um,###i mean, there wasn't any electricity on the camp site	###we only spent two nights there.###i wouldn't want --n40114a to spend more than two nights.###i wouldn't want --n4011e3 to go for like a week,
36711:16	###i don't know.###.###other than, you know, taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and, and sweeping it out everyday, it --n40255a's really hard to, to keep the sand and dirt out of it.###.###yeah,###well, what we were doing --n40278d, we were just going --n4027a8 to say, we're just going --n4027cf to sleep in the tent and hang out at night, so, you know,###no going in and out, and, or###what he wants --n402a40 to do --n402a4f, we had brought his friend along, was play in the tent.###it was like, no, this is not working,,###you can't do that,	###.###did,###.
36715:16	###yeah,###well, what we were doing --n40278d, we were just going --n4027a8 to say, we're just going --n4027cf to sleep in the tent and hang out at night, so, you know,###no going in and out, and, or###what he wants --n402a40 to do --n402a4f, we had brought his friend along, was play in the tent.###it was like, no, this is not working,,###you can't do that,###you get the tent all dirty.###.###did,###.	###we were at a beach site, too.###.###uh-huh.
36766:43	###they're so, bad.###.###really.###.###yeah,### that was, it's a really nice area,###i've been there before###and it's,### i, i couldn't imagine ge-, --n40418f living just sixty miles north of them###but they were plagued --n404292, they were plagued --n4042ad with them, with mosquitoes.	###but the minute the sun went down --n40447b, um, that's when it's usually, the minute the sun sets --n4044c2 the mosquitoes come out.###.###huh.
36775:13	###but they were plagued --n404292, they were plagued --n4042ad with them, with mosquitoes.###and you can go out, outside in the daytime, all right,###but the minute the sun went down --n40447b, um, that's when it's usually, the minute the sun sets --n4044c2 the mosquitoes come out.###.###huh.###.###i mean, just the very second,###it's really strange.### they, uh, they must, uh, work on that, you know,### the, i-, it gets cooler when the sun sets --n4047fb	###.###well, have you ever, have you ever taken any of those, um, what do they call this --n40496b, mumblex lights,###have you ever used those.
36794:15	###i bought them, mumblex###i really didn't get --n404c83 to use them like, oh, there's mosquitoes### let's turn them.###we just sort of lit them.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um, we weren't bothered --n404e34 that much by mosquitoes,###so, we didn't really contribute it to that.###but, um, i think in an area that --n404f64's really thick with mosquitoes,	###.###yeah.###.
36973:15	###and i can understand why.###um, i think their biggest problem is just, you know, obtaining food to live --n4003a2,###so when you have the basic needs, uh, being unmet --n4004c2, i don't think you think globally as far as, you know, being a threat to other people in the world.###.###.###so, as soon as they get their, their own home country taken care of --n4006da, then they'll consider, what they can do --n400709 with the rest of the world.###.###.###i believe communism is very much waning.###it's, uh, pretty much on the way out of the door, insofar as the strong hold that they used --n400947 to have --n400956,	###and their rebellions right now is the result of that.###if they can get the army, or the military to sway to their side, i think that, uh, --n400c67 it will be on the way out eventually.###.
37017:16	###uh-huh.###.###so,###.###but gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that, he's moving towards a two to three party system of government that, nor eliminating or diminishing the communist power,###.###.###and i guess that's where yeltsin steps in --n4024f5, so far as his politics of government goes, uh,###but i don't know how convinced --n402623 the people are --n402636 of him yet, myself.###.	###that's their ray of hope.###.###uh-huh.
37057:131	###uh-huh.###.###and in the long-term,###but i just think that because of the basic needs that the people don't have --n40375d,###i think that, uh, makes the problem most severe, and makes him look, look worse that what his, um, what his ideals are --n40388c, personally.###.###.###i agree.###what --n403a44's bad for the soviet system is that, they have the resources to grow and produce their food --n403a9f, but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should --n403aee.###.	###i think there's a, a large amount of corruption on the, the have and the have-nots. you know,###.###yeah.
37088:49	###yeah,###big time,###major,###but you know, that's, that's what --n4046b6 happens when, you know, the cork blows --n4046e1 and you can't handle it anymore.###i mean, that's that's the way the world, uh, you know, revolves that way --n40489d.###.###uh-huh. well, their knowledge, with, uh, better communication processes in this world now that's reached them is more educated than to the, uh, ways of the western world,###.###anyway, i really question, though, how much technology the average soviet is exposed --n404bb7 to --n404bc2.###.	###.###.###they,
37167:86	### this is, this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female.###.###i was afraid we might get into an argument.###.###right.###.###well, uh, i guess uh, there have been certainly a lot of changes --n4003d6 in the last couple of generations, for, uh, the roles of women###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###.
37171:51	###right.###.###well, uh, i guess uh, there have been certainly a lot of changes --n4003d6 in the last couple of generations, for, uh, the roles of women###.###uh-huh.###.###and uh, i guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now, and trying --n40059a to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities, you know,###.###right.###.	###.###yeah,### it, it seems too me like though that women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore, the women are spreading themselves thinner, than before.
37180:71	###.###they may be going to school, or may have elderly parents, or you know all sorts of other things.###.###yeah,### it, it seems too me like though that women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore, the women are spreading themselves thinner, than before.###.###oh, i think so.###.###.###absolutely.	###.###uh-huh.###.
37224:46	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i think sometimes other things suffer###and tha-,###i think it --n401657's hard to find a balance there.###.	###you're almost looked down upon --n401809 if you don't try --n401824 to do all of these things###and that's where the problem is --n40191c really.###.
37225:51	###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i think sometimes other things suffer###and tha-,###i think it --n401657's hard to find a balance there.###.###but in some ways i think we are expected --n40173a to do it all.	###and that's where the problem is --n40191c really.###.###right.
37295:91	###right.###.### it, it's kind of pull and tug,###.###yeah.###.###on the other hand, i can't imagine --n402e6d just being at home, uh, although i have a lot of interests and a lot of things i would like --n402ed0 to pursue --n402edf.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###no,### that, that's definitely true.
37325:52	### but, uh, but it, it's worked out for, for my family,### to have my cake and eat it too, kind of thing.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###that's a good deal.###where do you think this is going --n40399a in the future,###i mean, do you think things are going --n403a54 to change,	###.###well, i, i hope that they will change uh,### but, but i'm,
37353:90	###do you think we are, setting a trend.###.###i don't,###.###.###yeah,### i, well i see, i think --n4046da some people wanting --n4046ed to stay home more and take care of the children.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###.
37505:7	###i was reading in the paper tonight that the detroit tigers are going --n403189 to sign him.### and, uh, and the point of, of, i guess,###i don't understand the, the strategy of how baseball works --n403368,###but it seems that, you know, they can sign him tomorrow,###.###uh-huh.###.###and he could go in the team the next day,### and, and, and they put him in the lineup###and he hits a home run	###.###yeah,###well that's true.
37510:21	###uh-huh.###.###and he could go in the team the next day,### and, and, and they put him in the lineup###and he hits a home run###and all of a sudden he becomes a hero.###.###yeah,###well that's true.###.	###i mean, you're not, a-,###and all he has --n4038ec to do --n4038fb is one, you know, hit it once.###it doesn't,
37512:7	###and he could go in the team the next day,### and, and, and they put him in the lineup###and he hits a home run###and all of a sudden he becomes a hero.###.###yeah,###well that's true.###.### and, and all he has --n40376b to do --n40377a is hit the ball,###i mean, you're not, a-,	###it doesn't,### he can, he can stri-, he can swing a couple times, mumblex###if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can.
37524:13	### he can, he can stri-, he can swing a couple times, mumblex###if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can.###.###right.###.###it's an interesting, uh, an interesting concept of, of how they do it --n403c88.###but i agree with you### i think that, i think that's part of what, uh, baseball needs more of --n403e0b.### i, uh, i, i guess what --n403f5b bothers me is, is that when you go --n403f86, um, you wait and wait and wait###and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run	###i'd rather see the ball hit --n404253 around and have the people,###.###yeah,
37579:20	###.### y-, did you actually live in saint louis.###.###i lived in the suburbs of saint louis,###yeah.###.### ye-, everybody does, right.###.###yeah,###that's true too,.	###.###i had a friend from college that --n405f51 lives in, uh,###mumblex
37610:67	### i, i definitely do,###in fact i've got family that --n406434 still lives up there.###um, from what i hear --n4064f4 from everybody up there, they're not going --n40651f to have a good year because they let too many people go.###but i've been following spring training###and they're like one of the best teams in spring training so far.###.###well is that a good indicator.###.### that, well it can be.### it, it really kind of depends on, on, um, what they were, you know, what they were looking for --n4068e9.	###but if they were, uh, playing the people that they're going --n406c8f to play --n406c9e, then that might be pretty good indication,###so, you know, it's, it's not a great indication because there have been teams that --n406e18 have just, you know, come out and just won all kinds of games in spring crani-, training and then gone on a, you know, fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season###so,
37612:111	###um, from what i hear --n4064f4 from everybody up there, they're not going --n40651f to have a good year because they let too many people go.###but i've been following spring training###and they're like one of the best teams in spring training so far.###.###well is that a good indicator.###.### that, well it can be.### it, it really kind of depends on, on, um, what they were, you know, what they were looking for --n4068e9.###in other words, if, if in spring cra-, training they were looking at all their kids, like a lot of them do, um, then it really doesn't give you any indication.###but if they were, uh, playing the people that they're going --n406c8f to play --n406c9e, then that might be pretty good indication,	###so,###.###you know what i think --n40712b is remarkable is, uh,
37772:3	###it's amazing, uh,###i always thought that teachers never got paid --n4005d3 nearly enough, i mean, to be doing what they're doing --n400612, uh.###.###right.###.###when i was in college --n400758 i, i enjoyed teaching,###'cause i did some teaching part-time###and i really enjoyed that###but i wouldn't want --n4008bf to go --n4008ce teach high school or junior high,###it just, you know,	###.###oh, lord, i mean, yeah,###an, you talk about stress and pressure,
37942:27	###what --n40528d's going --n40529c to happen.###i mean i, i'm afraid for him to go.###.###exactly,###right.###.###but there again, you can't hold them back.###.###another reason, yo-,###and you want --n4054da to encourage them, you know, to, to be active and everything in school,	###.###yeah,###and lot tougher than it was when i was going to school --n405889,
37942:58	###what --n40528d's going --n40529c to happen.###i mean i, i'm afraid for him to go.###.###exactly,###right.###.###but there again, you can't hold them back.###.###another reason, yo-,###and you want --n4054da to encourage them, you know, to, to be active and everything in school,	###.###yeah,###and lot tougher than it was when i was going to school --n405889,
37967:11	###.###that's right,###that's right.###.### i'm afraid to, i'm afraid --n405d88 to even think about it.###.### that, yeah, that is a scary thought,###but, uh, i don't know,### i, i guess what you have --n405f8a to do --n405f99 is just, uh, keep in, uh, you know, --n405fe4 encouraging them and, and, uh, uh, try --n406023 to be open with them, so that y-, you can deal with the problems as they come up.###.	###.###yeah,###and.
38013:11	###.###.###well and i think, uh, you touched on it, you know,###you've got --n4074a2 to start them at the home.###.###yeah.###.###you know that's where they, that's where they get the, the deep rooted values --n40759c### and, and, and, uh, and that's about right.###.	###.###then you just have --n40784f to hope and pray that, that everything, uh, works out, works out okay,###so.
38101:57	###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###i mean, i, i always say that i need --n401242 to buy a computer for the house###but i just haven't got around to --n40135d doing it yet.###.###oh, yeah,###i'd like --n401429 to have one for the house, too,	###i don't want --n4015ed to come home and have --n401608 to work on one, too.###.###your husband, what, what group is your husband in --n4016ff.
38326:10	###yeah,###they come in real handy,###that was a lifesaver.###.###well, how many different types of packages do you use --n405075.###.###at home.###.###uh-huh.###.	###the packages i, i don't really use --n4051b8,### i mumblex what i use --n40524f that mumblex outside development that we use --n405272###most of it's just stuff that --n40534f's been written --n405362 in house that i use --n40537d.
38356:40	###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###a lot of the data entry stuff they used, uh, survey system and, and, um, you know, just in-house programs --n405a16 to do what they needed --n405a31.###i work,###.	###.###well, no,###i worked for this company before i had my first daughter,
38390:86	###so,###.###so, it keeps you in the company, huh.###.###that's right, you know,###it gives me a paycheck, you know,### it's only like the work's only, you know, three weeks. goes for like three to four weeks three times a year,###.###uh-huh.###.	###they only come out four times a year,###so###but.
38397:62	###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, it's not something that --n406684's continual because, you know, the television ratings don't come out, you know, all the time.###they only come out four times a year,###so###but.###.###yeah.###boy	###.###oh.###.
38421:42	###and i've got lots of documentation i need --n406c88 to review --n406c97 and some i need --n406cb2 to revise --n406cc1.###.###uh-huh,###will they let you take a computer home --n406e14 to work.###.###well, yeah,###but, you know, i need --n406ee9 to be at the office, too.###.###oh, uh-huh.###.	###but, a p c at the house would really take a lot of the load off.###.###yeah.
38537:16	###so most of my books are, um, i guess what you'd call --n4006c8 self improvement type of books.###.###that what i've been reading --n4007d1 lately a lot of.###um, my interests switch around dramatically.###i used --n4008da to read just, mainly fic-, fiction,###and now i, lik-, like a said, i've read a lot of self, self help books.###.###uh-huh.###what kind of things have you read --n400b49.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
38562:71	###.###um, as far as dealing with divorce.###.###oh, i'm kind of getting that one past me,###but a good self help book.###.###good self help.###.###yeah.###.	###.###um, that sounds good.###.
38748:90	###i'm a former t i-er.###i just recently quit.###and so, uh, i got myself involved in a sales job,###and right now, my list of books --n4052de to be read --n4052f1 have --n4052fc to do with, uh, the art of selling.###.###oh, uh-huh.###.###so.###.###it's just, i was just thinking,	###.###uh-huh.###.
38753:50	###oh, uh-huh.###.###so.###.###it's just, i was just thinking,### at, at rossa they tend --n40550a to come out with a new book every couple of weeks just --n405541 to help us deal with all the things that we have --n405574 to deal with --n405587.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, i keep --n40573f getting stacks of books i need --n405762 to read --n405771,	###.###never,###never
38955:13	###it takes a lot of concentration.###i mean, it was the type of thing,### i was, i was making some little things for christmas,###and i also made a little thing for a baby gift,###and, uh, i thought, oh, i can do this while i watch t v.###wrong.###.###right.###.###no,	### it's, it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be.###it took me, uh, quite a bit of time.###i though, oh, this won't take long at all.
38958:35	###and i also made a little thing for a baby gift,###and, uh, i thought, oh, i can do this while i watch t v.###wrong.###.###right.###.###no,###you must pay all attention to what you're doing --n4025ef.### it's, it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be.###it took me, uh, quite a bit of time.	###but i was wrong.###.###uh-huh.
39208:26	###but until then,###.###yeah,###i like both,###but since i'm in an apartment, i just, i don't think an apartment is big enough for a dog.### dogs, to me, dogs --n4077bc need a yard, even little dogs.###.###uh-huh.###.###they just need a yard.	###but i just think dogs need, need --n4079a5 to be outside, though.###so,###.
39646:48	###uh-huh.###.###.###okay.###.###and everybody loves it###and it's so easy,###and it's delicious.###.###that's what i was just thinking --n40595d,	###.###huh-uh,###it isn't.

40641:22	###.###oh, that's wonderful.###.###she gets home visitations by the s-, mumblex i don't know, the state boards, i guess, some of them and then some by the association,###and they have weekly meetings and everything###and, so it's just really, really well regulated.###.###that's great.###.###and, she's just great.	###and she says this is it, you know,###i'm not going --n405ca7 to have her anymore###and i said, oh, no, don't count on that.
40663:29	###and one year, i guess last year when i went back to work --n40604a i had###my son was eight --n406118 at the time, just barely eight,###and, uh, we put him in amrein's day care, after. after,###.###uh-huh,###i've heard that, they were very good.###.###.###well, that's why we picked it --n406342, because they were, were supposed --n406365 to be real great,###and, you know, i think they were fine,	###.###uh-huh.###.
40676:36	###.### in, in plano, it's open classroom situation where they don't have walls --n406627,###.###uh-huh.###.###so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders, in the same area with no walls.###.###oh.###.### and, uh, and then he'd get on the amrein's bus --n406822 to go to amrein's	###.###yeah.###.
40685:18	### and, uh, and then he'd get on the amrein's bus --n406822 to go to amrein's###and then there would be a whole ton of other kids, all in the same room, you know,###.###yeah.###.###you know what fun they had --n406a25 with these computer games###and then they'd go outside for awhile,###they had snacks and story time and everything.###but, it was just like going to school until five thirty at night instead of being able --n406bd5 to get home at two thirty.###.	###yeah.###.###yeah.
40705:8	###.###uh-huh.###.###or, you know.###.###uh-huh.###even at that age they need that time,###.###yes.###.	###.###yeah.###.
40762:29	###.###.### un-, understand.###.###and to know what we wan-, know what he was doing --n407eb8 you know, and enjoy it,###.###yeah.###.###and it was so much fun###and gosh he went a couple of weekends ago and rode an elephant	###.###oh, my gosh.###you're kidding.
40891:7	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.### and, and i got lucky	###.### because, because,###.
40929:14	###it's a little high,###.###yeah.###.### but, but it's, you know, it's like where he was --n40a65b before i was only paying sixty three,###so there's quite a little jump there,###.###right.###right.###.	###i looked in every day care there was --n40a8b9 in lewisville,###.###uh-huh.
41085:10	###i said, this can't be, you know,###nobody can have this many relatives,###.###.###because a lot of them lived in like a group, you know, down one highway.###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###.###and, there was a lake,	###.###oh, how nice.###.
41104:30	###.###oh, my gosh.###.###and i kept --n40212c thinking, this guy is putting me on.###.###.###nobody has this many relatives, you know.###.###yeah.###.	###.###how funny.###.
41147:13	###.###not be able to do it.###so, did people come like from out of town to the reunion###or,###.###oh, yeah.###yeah,###.###they did.###.	###.###did you put them up in other people's houses###or did you have hotel rooms,
41158:53	###.###did you put them up in other people's houses###or did you have hotel rooms,###or, how did you do it --n402cb6.###.###um, they just stayed with different ones of them.###.###they did.###uh-huh.###.	###and then, they had it.###.###uh-huh.
41190:29	###yeah.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh-huh.###.###well, i'm real curious because my family,###it didn't sound,###i don't think my family is as big as your husband's.###i don't think we'd need a whole church,	###.###.###there isn't any one place where most of us live --n4036c7,
41194:36	###uh-huh.###.###well, i'm real curious because my family,###it didn't sound,###i don't think my family is as big as your husband's.###i don't think we'd need a whole church,###but, um, the problem is we are all really scattered, around.###.###.###there isn't any one place where most of us live --n4036c7,	###i mean, you know, there would be one person who --n403885 lived there that --n403898 would have a house,###but they couldn't put everybody up.###so it, i think it would get kind of expensive.
41204:27	###so if we ever had a reunion, we'd kind of all have --n40378b to stay in a hotel.###i mean, you know, there would be one person who --n403885 lived there that --n403898 would have a house,###but they couldn't put everybody up.###so it, i think it would get kind of expensive.###.###but, you know what you can do --n403ae3.###.###huh.###.###a lot of these lakes and things, if you could find a centrally located,	###.###uh-huh.###.
41204:37	###so if we ever had a reunion, we'd kind of all have --n40378b to stay in a hotel.###i mean, you know, there would be one person who --n403885 lived there that --n403898 would have a house,###but they couldn't put everybody up.###so it, i think it would get kind of expensive.###.###but, you know what you can do --n403ae3.###.###huh.###.###a lot of these lakes and things, if you could find a centrally located,	###.###uh-huh.###.
41246:66	###.###uh-huh.###.###and, then it has little rooms off of it where, you know, you'd go and sleep at night time --n40434c.###.###oh.###.###but, then it has like a kitchenette and things like that###but you,###.	###.###right.###.
41271:50	###.###that sounds like fun.###.###what you can do --n404a61 is, you can write different places, the chamber of commerce, tell them what you're interested in --n404ab8.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
41298:19	### calling different places can r-, really run you up a bill.###.###yeah.###.###but, if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have --n4051c6 to come about the same distance --n4051e5,###i mean, you can't get it exact, you know, usually,###.###oh, yeah.###.### but, uh, and then everybody goes to that place.	###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.
41311:13	###uh-huh.###.###but, they have, lot of times they'll have like, uh, little cabins,###.###uh-huh.###.###and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have, you know, just the single bunk beds and stuff.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and then, you know, you can have cookouts and stuff like that###that doesn't cost you as much.###.
41374:97	###well, um, did you,###was it --n40652d hard to decide who --n406548 to invite --n406557 and who --n406566 not to invite --n406579.###i mean, did you have --n40666e to draw a line,###or did the people that --n40670f had that reunion have --n406726 to draw a line.###.###no.###.###like, they just###whoever, --n406831 wanted --n40683c to come.###.	###.###.###uh-huh.
41388:95	###.###.###right.###.###okay,###then those in turn got a hold of these other ones.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they had like,	###.###uh-huh.###.
41402:125	###.###uh-huh.###.###and, you know, they told them that what we had --n406e6f to do --n406e7e was when we sent back in our information --n406ea5, we had --n406eb8 to tell them how many people --n406ed7 were going --n406ee6 to be coming, you know.###.###yeah.###.###.###right.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
41406:30	###.###yeah.###.###.###right.###.###and then, when they, when they talked to us --n407143 or when they sent us the letter --n407166, it, uh, you know, to get the information and all, it asked, you know, will you be willing --n4071d5 to bring###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###oh, i see.###.
41558:14	###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, very, very little about it.###.###i just,###the thing is i know a lot of stories,###but i can't remember who it was about --n409a53.###my grandparents told us when i was growing up --n409aeb and even when i was an adult --n409b0e	###but i can't, you know, i remember these stories###but i have no idea who it was --n409e00 that --n409e0b was in those stories.###.
41558:61	###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, very, very little about it.###.###i just,###the thing is i know a lot of stories,###but i can't remember who it was about --n409a53.###my grandparents told us when i was growing up --n409aeb and even when i was an adult --n409b0e	###but i can't, you know, i remember these stories###but i have no idea who it was --n409e00 that --n409e0b was in those stories.###.
41744:101	###uh, we had no regulation against it###and a lot of the kids did of course,###and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers.###.###right.###.###because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts --n403b02.###.###right.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
41744:176	###uh, we had no regulation against it###and a lot of the kids did of course,###and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers.###.###right.###.###because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts --n403b02.###.###right.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
41774:39	###right.###.###but i can be professional too.###.### well, i, and i don't think that you have --n4044b7 to be manish and extremely tailored --n4044d6 to, to look professional.###.###right,###uh-huh.###.###i think that you, you make of that what you wish --n40468e	###.###right.###.
41873:8	###.###yeah,###well, i don't either.###fortunately i don't have --n40715e to work in those companies.###.###right.###.###but, uh, i, i, uh, did have a group come over from one of the banks, over the children's hospital where i was volunteering --n40727f###and, uh, they were doing a presentation###and every one of the young execs coming up --n407442 were dressed --n407451 exactly a like, men and women.	###i mean you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants.###and one was a skirt###and one was a pant.
42006:62	###i think,###.###i really do.###oh, yeah,###it's going --n401e4c to take, uh, you know,###the police, i think, i don't think --n401f27 can do it, can do it alone, you know.###.###that's right,###i think you're right.###.	###i'm sorry,###i'm trying --n4022a6 to,###my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed.
42012:25	###.###that's right,###i think you're right.###.### it's going --n40211f to take, uh, it's going --n402146 to take all of us getting together,###i'm sorry,###i'm trying --n4022a6 to,###my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed.###.###.	###.###right.###.
42051:38	###right,###i know it.###.###an-, you know### if, if, you know### i, i think to be, you know being convicted --n402e19 is one thing, you know,### and that's, and that's great if they're con-, if they're sentenced --n402f9d to death,###to me you could not sentence them to death unless, the case was for sure.###i mean it ha-,###.	###.###right,###right,
42149:22	###.### i have, i have my doubts, you know.###.###that's right,###yeah,###yeah,###i do too.###.### i, you know, i don't know,###i think there's a point,	###.###right.###.
42225:12	###.###they don't kill them.###they just mo-,###.###they don't kill them,###no.###.###gosh.###.###they've tak-,	###.###gosh.###.
42283:32	###and the boys were gone###and the back fence was open.###.###oh, gosh,###oh gosh.###.###mumblex, you know.###.###yeah.###.	###this happens all the time.###and we walked through the fence out,###the alleys, ar-, come to the back of the house, you know.
42284:10	###and the back fence was open.###.###oh, gosh,###oh gosh.###.###mumblex, you know.###.###yeah.###.###and she didn't act like it bothered her at all, oh,	###and we walked through the fence out,###the alleys, ar-, come to the back of the house, you know.###.
42293:52	###and she didn't act like it bothered her at all, oh,###this happens all the time.###and we walked through the fence out,###the alleys, ar-, come to the back of the house, you know.###.###uh-huh,###yeah.###.### and wal-, and i looked down both directions of the alley###and i saw neither one of them	###.###oh.###.
42407:38	###that's terrible.###.### never be the same,###so, i don't know,### it's, it's really scary###and i don't know what --n4097d9 to, i don't know what --n4097fc needs --n409807 to be done --n40981a, you know###it seems like there's no room in jails to put them in jail###and when they do put them in there --n409a3f, you know,### we-, i'm taking a business law class at night###and the guy that --n409b95 teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney	###.###oh, gosh.###.
42587:40	### i, i just think it makes honest people more honest###and,###.### and, and the people who --n402369 want it, it --n402380's not that big a deal, like i say, to wait.###.###right.###right.###and, if you have --n40250d to have it in a hurry, something's wrong.###.###yeah,	###.###.###that's right.
42735:37	###.###yeah.###and, the police love it. which --n404b0b really surprised me###.###um.###.### and, and, i think, and that's what they were going after --n404bf9, uh,###they went --n404cfb to interview this town,###i mean it's a little dinky town,###they went --n404de1 to interview them about the gun control laws	###we could care less.###you know, we're all honest, and everything like, that,###.
42737:20	###and, the police love it. which --n404b0b really surprised me###.###um.###.### and, and, i think, and that's what they were going after --n404bf9, uh,###they went --n404cfb to interview this town,###i mean it's a little dinky town,###they went --n404de1 to interview them about the gun control laws###and, uh, the police said --n404e87, mumblex all the people said --n404ea6, that's fine###we could care less.	###.###huh.###.
42741:23	### and, and, i think, and that's what they were going after --n404bf9, uh,###they went --n404cfb to interview this town,###i mean it's a little dinky town,###they went --n404de1 to interview them about the gun control laws###and, uh, the police said --n404e87, mumblex all the people said --n404ea6, that's fine###we could care less.###you know, we're all honest, and everything like, that,###.###huh.###.	###but we, we don't mind --n405130 being checked --n40513f.### and, uh, and i think it kind of took that uh, neatness away from it, you know,###like, well heck, everybody's got one, you know
42859:25	###.###oh.###.###yeah,###well we, we're trying --n40722b to teach our daughter.###she knows real well about, uh, about her daddy's guns, what not to do --n40731f and what to do --n40733a around them.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.	###when he's mumblex --n40754a,###.###yeah, um,
42930:18	###.###still.###.###and then i've got it so far,###sometimes i think, i wonder if i, i'm not about --n408795 to load it because i, you know, i assume that the kids are not going --n4087e0 to ever get up there,###.###uh-huh.###.###and it's in a case,###and it's, you know, it's put --n408a5b up	###.###right.###.
43037:38	###.###well,###.### guess it makes it worth the dog food over the years.###.###yeah.### really does.###well, do you think we've,###.###yeah,	###.###me too, on gun control.###.
43160:33	###well, that's pretty wild.###yeah,###we used it for fleas.###we had fleas in our yard real bad last year,###and we did that um,### i just, i'm not,###basically, i like --n401bc6 to mow the lawn, believe it or not,###but i sometimes have problems --n401ca3 starting the mower,###so a lot of times i won't get out and do it,###but my husband, basically, does most of it,	###and we're renting,###and so we don't really put a lot of money into the, uh, you know, like###this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt, and some saint augustine.
43225:114	###and we prayed that we could get rid --n40335a of these fleas,###and we got rid --n4033f6 of them, believe it or not, with smoke bombs, which --n403435 is just about impossible to do --n40345c,###but we did,###and so we don't want them back this year, you know.###so i'll remember that if we see it's a problem in the yard.###we're almost,###they were so bad last year, even ticks.###i don't know,###we've had ticks before a lot,###and we've had --n4038bb to get out and treat our lawn for that.	###but that's about the extent of our lawn care.###so, i don't know,###do you enjoy --n403c61 doing it.
43268:33	###but right now where we're living --n4047ab we have the trees where their, uh, roots are at the top of the ground everywhere over the ground --n404806.###i don't know what kind of trees they are --n404944,###but you can't have a garden,###you can't till it,###or it'll, it'll tear up a nice tiller.###so we're going --n404b32 to wait until we move.###we don't have a lot of sun, either, because it's big trees back there.###so we're going --n404cb5 to wait,###and when we move --n404d26 that's one of our priorities, is to get a house where we can have a, uh, garden --n404d85.###and so i'd like --n404eb5 to do that.	###but that's our next thing.###do you have a garden.###.
43282:12	###i've got, the,###this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at --n405143.### sitting on about a two acre lot now,###.###uh-huh.###.###and half of it's, the back half is my garden.###.###oh, are you kidding.###that sounds fun.	###.###uh, in missouri city.###.
43316:23	###and i'm excited about it.###and then i don't know anything about it,###i have --n405a7e to learn,###and then you'll have --n405ae7 to give me a call on gardening.###.###.###what do you do --n405b9c in your garden,###and i'll go nothing,###what should i do --n405c62.###but anyway, i guess that's about it though.	###so i guess we'll let you go,###and, um, do you have anything else you wanted --n405e7e to say --n405e8d.###.
43481:23	### i, i didn't, i didn't even like the previews on that.###.###oh, i know.###it was,###well i ended up at the theater###and there was, didn't seem --n40277b to be anything else --n402792 on i wanted --n4027a9 to see --n4027b8,###so i'll try that.###.###.###but it wasn't worth anything.	###.###no.###.

43574:15	###.###a real dog and cat.###.###.###huh.###.###and all the other animals.###they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised --n4044ec --n4044f3.###and then the cat gets, um, on this treacherous journey.###he climbs into a box and ends up --n40464e floating down this river	###i don't know where in the world it is --n40476a.###somewhere in china somewhere i think that it was filmed --n40480f --n404816.###.
43800:90	###oh, boy.###so, that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that.###.###yeah,### it was, yeah it was unimpressive to look at --n407f66.###i mean, the whole thing was about the size of a, a medium house.###yeah.###it wasn't,###.###oh, really.	###.###oh, yeah.###.
43824:67	###yeah.###there's some nice stuff --n408515 over there to see --n408534.###.###yeah.###.### i, i spent four years --n4085fb traveling around and didn't see, you know, hardly anything.###i just,###.###oh, boy.###.	###.###.###yeah.
43917:38	###.###yeah.###it --n409d7f's hard to know what the good movies are --n409dae anymore.###.###yeah.###.###because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by --n409e98.###.###yeah.### i, i us-,	###.###yeah.###.
44046:72	###and they painted it kind of like a spun of a sorts###so it's real cheap.###and, uh, uh, i've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and i, as low as five hundred and forty dollars###so it's, just a matter of,###.###wow. that's quite a range.###.###it's,###.###.	###and i'm so much --n401dd7 worried about that as what,###i don't want it all over the brick and windows###.
44048:18	###and, uh, uh, i've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and i, as low as five hundred and forty dollars###so it's, just a matter of,###.###wow. that's quite a range.###.###it's,###.###.###oh, there one guy --n401c76 brags about his piece of equipment he's using --n401ca5 and the drop cloths and all that kind crap###and i'm so much --n401dd7 worried about that as what,	###.###yeah.###.
44080:56	###and we have, we have some more that --n40239e need --n4023a9 to be done --n4023bc,###.###uh-huh.###.###but the, the problem that we've, we've owned this house almost five years now,###and, um, when we bought it --n402606 the, um, it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired, mumblex###but the daughter was a real estate agent###and she was selling it###and it's been lived in --n40280c briefly by her before she bought her town house.###so she told us that the house had been, uh, professionally painted --n402906 recently.	###but they obviously had been done --n402abb without to much, uh, wear afterward.###the only problem was when we started --n402b90 having the movers move the furniture in --n402bb3 we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood-, uh, the door frames,###.
44119:61	###so it looked as if it had been painted --n403467, correctly with, you know, uh, an enamel or something,###.###uh-huh.###.###but, um, it had not, either that or it had not been prepared --n4035c6 underneath###and it was greasy or something,###.###sure.###.###it comes off in strips, i mean not even little bit.	###.###oh, no.###.
44144:14	###.### thank you.###.###bye-bye.###.###bye.###.###.###so, how do you feel --n40002a about our policy in latin america..###.	###yeah.###no,### i, uh, i think we've been doing a pretty good job, you know, not, uh, not taking advantage of our, you know, of the financial dependence that most of the countries have --n400246 on us, you know, uh,
44180:26	###his descendants are from, uh, uh, nicaragua and, uh, very,###i mean it's like his mother, his, mother came over###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, he, you know,###i just get sorry feelings for people that --n400f4b their family came from there and how they feel --n400f76 about, you know, our intervention and their government and stuff like that,###.###uh-huh.###.	###there's so many people --n40123c there that, that --n401253 get the kind of control that --n401272's bad, you know,###.###uh-huh.
44322:37	###well, i guess i do in a way,###sometimes i think --n404539 a religion has a lot --n404558 to do with that.###i think that, that, uh, because of those co-, countries a lot, you know, where such catholic influence.###and i think the catholic religion itself was, was such a dominant factor, as far as keeping the people down, so to speak,###.###.###i thought, it was the other way around.###.###but,###.	###so all the persecution that they're sort of use to --n404adf it, it's been, sort of like, you know.###.###uh.
44323:7	###sometimes i think --n404539 a religion has a lot --n404558 to do with that.###i think that, that, uh, because of those co-, countries a lot, you know, where such catholic influence.###and i think the catholic religion itself was, was such a dominant factor, as far as keeping the people down, so to speak,###.###.###i thought, it was the other way around.###.###but,###.###they were always having --n404a0a to meet in the catacombs and all this,	###.###uh.###.
44494:42	###it may be free###but is it good education###and that's just it###are we willing --n4086a4 to pay for it, you know,###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###but, so are they willing --n40884b to, pay for, you know quality education, you know.###.###uh. uh-huh.
44590:20	###oh, for sure.###.###.###oh, yeah.###.###so, i've had this dog now for, for sixteen years###and she's been a lot of company.###uh, she's, uh, however, getting a little old###and things are starting --n401946 to fail.###uh, i, i live --n4019bf alone now	###and, uh, she's been holding herself pretty well. the, uh, up until, you know, recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is --n401b9f --n401ba6###and, uh, i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home --n401db6.###but she's, she's usually pretty good.
44700:49	###.###yeah.###.###.###uh, and, and, you know, some people might not believe that### but, but, but, uh, i do.###.###sure.###oh, absolutely.###.	###.###really.###.
44717:87	###well, i had that cat that i mentioned --n404c57, alfie.###one morning, you know,###the first thing you do --n404d54 is you get up and you, you, you feed this cat some-, something and, and you make sure that it can get to its litter box.###well, for some reason during the night, the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, the next morning, uh, when my roommate got up and, and, uh, did not feed it right away --n40515b, it decided that, that it was going --n405186 to protest.###.###.	###.###.###all right.
44733:22	###oh, yes.###animals have a way of talking.###.###alfie did.###i tell you###if i could have gotten a hold of that cat that day.###.### i, i don't know that i'd, uh, that i'd trade my dog in for the world.###uh, it was about two years ago she got sick on me --n405897###and i took her to the, uh, to the vet's because she wasn't eating and, and, uh, she wasn't able --n4059ad to jump.	###and, uh, she stayed there for one day###and the doctor called me up and said, uh, she had a low white cell count and that, uh, she wasn't, she was dying and, uh, suggested that i take her to a working hos-, dog hospital, animal hospital.###so i took his suggestion
44769:82	###.###yeah.###well, the, see the problem is if, if the, if someone would have came up to me and said it's going --n406ab9 to cost you five hundred dollars --n406ad8 to keep your dog alive. what do you want --n406b07 to do --n406b16. i probably would have had second thoughts.###.###yeah.###of course, you would.###.###but what they, well, what they do --n406e53 is, is they say, well it's going --n406e82 to cost, you know, twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this### and, and, you know, and it creeps up on you.###you don't know that, uh, you know.	###.###.###uh, to give you an example. my mom had an elderly cat who, uh,
44786:25	###and she had the cat there for two days###and then the cat died.###so the doctor had called her up and said, uh, your cat died###and you owe me this bill,###and oh, by the way, do you want me to, to bury the cat.###.###.###so, it cost her three hundred dollars, uh,###and she didn't get the cat back.###so, yeah,	###.###.###and, uh, you know, she just brought the cat in because he wasn't feeling good.
44890:38	###i mean that's the only, thing that i can figure --n400a51 out because i've heard so many people say well i'm not going on voting on that one, you know,### i, i'm going --n400c21 to go --n400c30 fishing today.###or it won't make any difference if, if i don't vote###.###.###and i think it does.###we vote every time.###.###well, it, uh, there's no question###it does make a difference.	###.###.###right.
44948:39	###so it's now, uh, to the forefront###and people are finally taking some action against it.###and the thing, we've, we've neglected the value of voting. and uh, and what it --n4024d0 really means --n4024df --n4024e6 to vote###.###right.###.###and we also don't make the, uh, the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them --n4026a3.###.###yeah.###well i don't know how it is --n4027c9 up there	###.###uh-huh.###.
45012:112	###right.###.###right.###.###and i hear so many people saying well i wish this would change,###i wish that### and, you know, but they didn't go --n403d58 vote.###.###that's right.###.	###.###that's right.###.
45133:59	###.###i mean, you know, it would have --n407042 to be a child that --n40705d is just coming into school.###because, well i'll tell you another thing too now.### whenever, the first time i voted --n40721c, i never voted in high school because there was never anyone that --n407257 showed us how to use the voting machines --n407282,###.###uh-huh.###.###now this sounds dumb,###but i did not know how to use those voting machines --n407489###and nobody ever showed us or anything	###.###yeah.###.
45162:38	###well###sure it is.###.###now that's bad.###and i mean i was out of school.###i was a married person.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, i didn't know how --n407dc0 to work the machine, you know --n407de3.	###where if they'd, if they'd had a class or something or just to a short time, you know, to, said okay, this is the way,###.###well, just the, just the opportunity to try the voting machines,
45305:43	###it's telling, um, you know###when we had, um, we had a cat when we first married --n4016c8,###no, took,###yeah,###we had the cat first,###and then we got, uh, the chow.###and,, bring, um, bringing them in as puppies they got along just fabulous with her.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and they'd just play###and they were never, they never harmed her.###so, uh, they got along great,
45336:87	###five.###.###five.###.###she's a real mumblex.###.###so, you had the dogs before you had the baby.###.###right.###and i was,, not really concerned about, um, them harming her,	###.###uh-huh.###.
45398:108	###exactly,###that or, or, uh, the other extreme,### they're, they're terrified of them###and i hate that,###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###and they shouldn't be,###i mean, some maybe	###and a lot of kids are scared of that. and which i understand --n403c34 because she is, you know, a lot of movement and everything###but when she calms down --n403da6 they're so scared of her###it's,
45406:45	###and they shouldn't be,###i mean, some maybe### but, but, um, like our miniature schnauzer, she's just, she's just like, um, a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody --n403a8a acting silly,###and a lot of kids are scared of that. and which i understand --n403c34 because she is, you know, a lot of movement and everything###but when she calms down --n403da6 they're so scared of her###it's,###.###huh.###.### it, that bothers me because she's the friendliest thing,	### and, and, and that's mainly people that --n404030 have never had pets around their children,###so, i think, i think it --n404162's a good idea to have them.### we've had, um, in the past, we've had birds --n40429d, too, uh, like cockatoos. and parrots and, the big white, birds with the, the orange crest on top.
45526:54	###.###.###and then my cats would knock it over.###.###yeah.###.###i have --n405fb3 to be real careful about where i put things --n405fde,###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###oh, no.###oh, no.
45587:16	###.###and my husband went out of town, and left me with, with the brand new puppy,###.###oh, fun.###.###and i had --n4070f4 to work twelve hours that day,###.###oh, no.###.###and so, i left the dog --n4071c4 locked --n4071cf in the bedroom	###well, when i came home --n4072d8, i opened the door###and there were chunks of carpet, padding everything, all over the place###.
45589:33	###.###oh, fun.###.###and i had --n4070f4 to work twelve hours that day,###.###oh, no.###.###and so, i left the dog --n4071c4 locked --n4071cf in the bedroom###and i put paper all over the floor.###well, when i came home --n4072d8, i opened the door	###.###oh.###.
45629:23	###and i wasn't really involved in the, the paper training, and, you know, teaching him commands and stuff###.###sure.###yeah.###.###so, this was, and to me, a whole new experience.###.###yes###it is.###.	###.###no,###no.
45671:44	###yeah.###.###and then it --n4088c5 doesn't matter where you put it --n4088e8 and where you hide it --n408903,###.###yeah.###.###and how, how tight you have the lid down on it --n408a1b,###.###.###they'll get into it.	###.###oh, i hate that.###.
45775:22	###what's that --n400a9e.###.###who's their quarterback --n400aec.###.###uh, jim kelly.###.###yeah.###yeah.###i like --n400ba4 to watch them, too.###they're the,	###but, um, of course, i watch every saints game that i can watch --n400d10.###.###uh-huh.
45780:100	###.###yeah.###yeah.###i like --n400ba4 to watch them, too.###they're the,###i like --n400c60 to watch almost all the football###but, um, of course, i watch every saints game that i can watch --n400d10.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah.###.
45822:33	###but they got so much bad publicity, too.###and i think that hurt a lot of, you know, people even wanting --n401997 to play on their team.###.###w-,###.###.###yeah.### w-, w-, well, yeah.###uh, firing tom landry and hiring jimmy johnson### what, what kind of, uh, uh,	### any t-, any team that, tha-, where the owner would fire tom landry, you know, is like one of the greatest coaches of all time --n401dbd.###.###right.
45823:112	###and i think that hurt a lot of, you know, people even wanting --n401997 to play on their team.###.###w-,###.###.###yeah.### w-, w-, well, yeah.###uh, firing tom landry and hiring jimmy johnson### what, what kind of, uh, uh,### doesn't give you much respect for their team at all.	###.###right.###right.
45870:23	###and, i don't know,###that sounds to me more --n4029eb like the front office problem than coaching problem,###but then the team was sold --n402aa9.###.###yeah.###.###so,###.###but, uh, that jimmy johnson came in, too, though,###and he just, you know,	###and it was bad.###.###yeah.
45917:57	###.###yeah.###.###we had one guy that --n403c17 couldn't throw###and we had one guy that --n403ca5 couldn't run.###.###huh.###.###and, it was, it was just bedlam.###we really didn't have a quarterback.	###.### did they, were they able --n403f6c to draft anybody this year.###.
45975:11	###so that doesn't, doesn't help you in the draft.###.###right.###but we, really, i mean, really and truly we just don't have a quarterback,###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.	###but, the players and stuff, they finally quit --n404be4 giving away the really good players and started --n404c0b keeping them too.###.###uh-huh.
46006:24	###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###and it was weird.###it was like they were trying,###if you were good, boy, let's don't have you on our team, you know.###.###.	###.###yeah.###.
46010:13	###.###and it was weird.###it was like they were trying,###if you were good, boy, let's don't have you on our team, you know.###.###.###but, um, this year they had all good players except for the quarterback.###.###yeah.###.	###i think they played, uh,###i can't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks,###but all of them were bad.
46013:7	###if you were good, boy, let's don't have you on our team, you know.###.###.###but, um, this year they had all good players except for the quarterback.###.###yeah.###.###the quarterback, all of them, every one that they played --n4054a8,###i think they played, uh,###i can't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks,	###.###huh.###.
46024:13	###.###huh.###.###i mean, they were terrible.###they could not pitch.###you know, they couldn't even take handoffs.###it was, terrible.###.###right.###.	###.###oh, that's one, it's one thing,###.
46086:11	###.###i was born --n406a96 in buffalo###and i lived in, uh, outside of boston for five years###and then my family lives in philadelphia now### and, uh, so i tend --n406c29 to look for, uh, uh,###.###teams in your area.###.###and i lived in detroit, too.###so i like, uh,	###and then i'll, uh, normally check out the eagles or the patriots###and, patriots were so depressing --n406f7c this last year that yeah, that, uh, i kind of gave up on them.###.
46242:22	###you definitely are going --n4004b4 to worry about the location, and, uh, you know, accessibility --n4004f3 of people to be able --n400512 to break in.###i live on a third floor now,###but, i, you know, i'm real concerned that i, i don't want --n400708 to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that --n40074b,###and, the, um,###.###do they have many buildings that --n400940 have security there.###.###some buildings do,###it depends on the location.###the area i live in --n400a60 right now, is, is real good as far as crime rate is concerned	###no burglar alarms, no guards.### some, some places do have guard gates that you have --n400c65 to get through --n400c78, or electronic access gates and things like that.###uh-huh.
46306:108	###yeah.###.###speakerb29-1*t29-1.###yeah,###speakeranan*t29-1.###speakera29-2*t29-2.###it's really sad.###speakerbnan*t29-2.###.###it is	###.###uh-huh,###.
46484:138	###if,###you wouldn't even have --n406083 to leave it,###i mean,###.###yeah,###that's true,###.###it would get snatched --n40619b right off your arm.###.###that's true.	###.###oh sure.###.
46535:24	###uh-huh.###.###i mean, we educate them,###we feed them,###we take care of them###and they no sooner get out on the street###and they're back in again.###.###uh-huh.###.	###but i think people who --n407490 are guilty of really serious heinous crimes, do not deserve --n4074c3 to be cared for --n4074da for the rest of their lives.###.###uh-huh.
46564:65	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###or, if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior, for every year they're in --n407d0d they get so many less, you know, that they don't serve the full penalty.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###oh, yeah,###i agree, because it --n4080a1's not fair to those of us that, that --n4080d0 deserve a safe, you know, life to have --n408103 to,
46591:151	###.###i mean you have --n4084db to set an example.###you have --n40856a to start somewhere.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i think that people know that they're going --n40860e to get a slap on the wrist, they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
46620:36	###like in dallas i mean they've had,###they're up in the top, top five i think of cities that --n408e94 are getting policeman killed --n408eab on, on, in the line of duty###and that's really sad.###.### it is,###it really is.###and i mean, they're the first ones that --n409169 take the brunt of everything.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
46628:41	###uh-huh.###.###you know, and i'm not saying that they're all good either, because there's good and bad in everything,###.###uh-huh.###.###but they, they're already, uh, have str-, three strikes against them when they're out there --n4093f3.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and you have --n4096b0 to even be careful how you arrest them --n4096d7, how you talk to them --n4096f6, uh, you know, what they say --n409721,###.###.
46628:63	###uh-huh.###.###you know, and i'm not saying that they're all good either, because there's good and bad in everything,###.###uh-huh.###.###but they, they're already, uh, have str-, three strikes against them when they're out there --n4093f3.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and you have --n4096b0 to even be careful how you arrest them --n4096d7, how you talk to them --n4096f6, uh, you know, what they say --n409721,###.###.
46628:79	###uh-huh.###.###you know, and i'm not saying that they're all good either, because there's good and bad in everything,###.###uh-huh.###.###but they, they're already, uh, have str-, three strikes against them when they're out there --n4093f3.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and you have --n4096b0 to even be careful how you arrest them --n4096d7, how you talk to them --n4096f6, uh, you know, what they say --n409721,###.###.
46710:8	###that's true.###.###and it's just amazing###and then they got,###and you know they're not making them like that now, d-, d-, you know,###.###no,###.###so,###.	###.###but they're still, they're still a lot, i think --n401930, definitely better than the american carmaker system.###.
46900:25	###.###but,###.###so,###.###huh.###.###maybe someday.###.###yeah,	###.###yeah.###.
46965:45	###oh.###.###they're only going --n406243 to make like three or four thousand.###so, he went out###and he traded the other one in and got this one,###.###wow, i haven't seen those.###.###and i'm like, um,###but, uh, i haven't seen one yet either	###.###wow.###.
47004:23	###um, but he, i think he, he only spent, you know, the low twentys###so, i don't know.###.###really.###.###.###now, see, i would have never figured that,###i would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that --n406ee9's limited edition.###.###well, i don't know,	###i think you can,###the prices aren't as high, you know,###and the, the mu-, miata was first introduced --n4071de, uh,
47236:31	###and there's some pretty decent campgrounds although, i don't think raleigh, i don't think the state of north carolina takes,###they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might.###.###uh-huh.###yeah,###my wife's from the western part of virginia,###we've been down the parkway a lot,###but i didn't know how much, how much camping areas there were --n40263a along there.###.###i think there's quite a few.	###.### what, what's it --n40283c like --n402847 camping in the desert and california,###that seems, like a challenge.
47256:20	###just the sky is so amazing.###you know, you really can probably count thousands of stars,###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, it's, it's just kind of nice.###i like the, uh,###i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which, uh, a lot of people don't realize --n402df7,###you know, they hear desert###and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry, and lack of water,	###but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just don't find --n4030e9 anyway else except in a desert.###.###uh-huh.
47263:10	###i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which, uh, a lot of people don't realize --n402df7,###you know, they hear desert###and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry, and lack of water,###course it, it has all of those qualities###but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just don't find --n4030e9 anyway else except in a desert.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, it's pretty nice.### the, uh, the movie, the doors, has so-, some nice desert scenes,	###.###yeah.###.
47313:36	###we've talked about --n403e36 planning a trip up through, um,###i have a sister-in-law that --n403ef0 lives in new mexico, up through new mexico and into colorado and the grand canyon area.###i don't know, don't know when i'm going --n404056 to get a chance --n40406d to do that --n404080###but,###.###yeah.###well, that would be, that would be pretty nice.### i've been, i have been camping on the south rim the grand canyon.###that's okay.###a lot of people like --n40439c to go down and camp down inside,	###.###uh-huh.###.
47415:15	###but, um, i never mumblex,###a major owner of our t-, of the team here.###.###oh, really.###i didn't know that.###.###yeah,### he's like, i thought he was the owner###but it turns out my mom said that he's part owner###but he must own the biggest chunk	###.###uh-huh.###.
47486:23	###.###but, yeah,###not my a lot,###and then somebody else lost,###maybe it was the other new york team which --n402914 is the yankees,###.###uh-huh.###.###but i don't even know if they're still new york yankees, or mumblex new jersey.###.	###.###yeah.###.
47559:6	### we mumblex they called us at five###and the game started at seven###so we just threw everything together, ran over and got the tickets and walked###and so we took two kids with us###and nobody brings two children in these seats, you know because,###.###because they're fancy seats and stuff.###.###yeah,###and you just sit down	###i just was there, you know,###like i'm loaded,###i'm here, you know,
47559:15	### we mumblex they called us at five###and the game started at seven###so we just threw everything together, ran over and got the tickets and walked###and so we took two kids with us###and nobody brings two children in these seats, you know because,###.###because they're fancy seats and stuff.###.###yeah,###and you just sit down	###i just was there, you know,###like i'm loaded,###i'm here, you know,
47571:26	###like i'm loaded,###i'm here, you know,###and, uh, it was just kind of funny because,###you know, but we got --n404257 to sit by first base###if they did hit a ball i would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in, you know.###.###i know i'm always scared of that whenever i go to a game --n404466.###i rarely go###but we went last year###because my brother, my brother is impossible, when, um,	###.###uh-huh.###.
47579:21	###but we went last year###because my brother, my brother is impossible, when, um,###he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and if there's a game on, he's watching it.	###.###really.###.
47614:10	###it wasn't a real problem,###but you sit there in a crowd,###and you're waiting and waiting and waiting###and you eat these lousy the hot dogs, um,###because we made him try a hot dog, you know mumblex,###.###that's funny.###.### and, um, so you sit there###and you wait for the longest time --n40536d really bored,	###but you happen --n405451 to look the other way during the time,###.###you miss the whole thing.
47702:30	###.###were any of them twins.###.###i mean, i'm not kidding you.###.###you probably can't afford --n406677 to eat if you have more than two of them.###.###no,###your,###i have a friend --n40679d now that --n4067ac has seven.	###.###uh-huh.###.
47706:9	###.###you probably can't afford --n406677 to eat if you have more than two of them.###.###no,###your,###i have a friend --n40679d now that --n4067ac has seven.### and, um, and they're all eight and under, and nine and under,###.###uh-huh.###.	###they're just raised --n40696e right###that's what god's told them --n4069d7 to do --n4069e6###but they're not condemning you,
47715:74	###.###they're all real young,###they're just raised --n40696e right###that's what god's told them --n4069d7 to do --n4069e6###but they're not condemning you,###if you,###we only have one child, you know,### they don't say, they don't put mumblex on bad or anything which --n406bab is good because it --n406bc2 would be easy, i'm sure, for them to do that,###you get a conviction like that###and you think everyone should have it.	###.###uh-huh.###.
47778:28	###uh-huh.###.###and he's, you know,###a lot of wisdom in it.###and the kids at bible talk about anything but training,###and training is different than anything else### in, in psychology doesn't address it.### a lot of the psychology stuff, the good stuff that --n40843a's in psychology it just comes out of the bible###and they don't quote you the proverb out of it,###but the things that --n4085f0 work in psychology other the years that they've proven --n40861f to work, they just come out of the bible	###so they're not going --n40885e to be a curse to you when they're thirteen --n40888d.###.###uh-huh.
47822:11	###.###yeah.###.###but mumblex your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids.###.###well, mumblex church mumblex softball leagues,###so,###.###uh-huh.###.	###and right now we don't have a girls' league because i'm the one that --n40968c's supposed --n40969b to start one###and i just haven't gotten around to --n4097ac doing it.###i keep --n409833 saying we need --n40984a to have one.
47867:4	###i had my tubes tied --n40a4b7###so you,###.###.###okay.###.###okay,###now when you baby-sit --n400056, what age group children do you sit with --n400081.###.###well, gosh	###.###uh-huh.###.
47902:11	###.###uh, one parent.###.###one parent.###.###yeah.###she's just,###.###how much time did she spend --n400bda with them.###.	###i mean, i would get there at eight o'clock in the morning,###the children usually weren't awake by then.###and she would get home at like five thirty in the afternoon.
47967:36	###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, like in the summer we were always in the library programs --n401f9c reading books###and we went --n402056 skating a lot###and, you know, she was just always there for us,###but nowadays if there are two parents to a family, the mother works just as hard as the father does,###and the children either stay at home and get into trouble###or they're stuck in a day care.###and i just, i just don't want my children to have --n402389 to be raised --n40239c like that.	###they got --n40253b to stay at home by themselves###and when i was younger --n4025d1 i thought they were lucky because they got --n4025fc to get away with things, like i couldn't ride my bike across the street, but they could because their mom would never know it.###.
48125:28	###but we did### and, and we lived in a trailer for eighteen years.###.###huh.###.###and, um, you know, we, we only had one car,###we only had one telephone, you know,###.###uh-huh.###.	###but i, i feel like that it helped me now because i appreciate the value of the dollar,###.###right.
48159:18	###.###it's way too late,###.###right.###.###i agree.###.###and, uh, while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child's in the elementary school --n4064d0 and they get into the high schools so often they seem --n406503 to drop away at that point.###and, that is just as valuable --n40669e, at that time, as to the rush in the elementary.###.	###.###.###yes,
48175:84	###and the parent really needs --n40686b to be there for the child.###.###right.###and, uh, the child needs --n406933 to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something.###uh, we were fortunate in view of the fact that my son did play football###and i did keep statistics for his team,###and, his dad did take movies of the football team and movies of the basketball team,###.###oh, great.###.	###.###yeah.###.
48212:71	###.###no.###.###oh.###.###no,###he, uh, works, uh, for a different company.###yeah,###in the dallas area###but when he went away to coll- --n407ae7,	###and he held three jobs. wally was in college###and we didn't even know it.###.
48250:19	###.### any, any kind of firearms.###.###really.###.###yeah.###uh, it's,###there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught --n400723, um, with a firearm###and also i think there was a fine.###.	###.###no,###i don't,
48330:43	### did, did you, were you brought up in a family that --n40253c hunted###or,###.###no.###uh, nobody in my family hunted,###uh, my father had, had guns when i was in high school --n4026ee because he got them from a friend who --n402715 lived in massachusetts.###we lived in new hampshire at the time.###.###how about that.###.	###.###huh.###.
48396:37	###and --n4044e4 coming from the north east, i'm just not used to --n40451b seeing, um, these,###and i, i know this may sound kind of stereo typical###but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks. that's kind of scary to me###.###oh, sure.###.###that kind of, to me it is more like vigilantism.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###.
48416:14	###um, especially not in the back window, for everybody to see --n404c93.###.###yeah,###that's kind of, kind of wild.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###that is kind of wild.	###well, thanks for talking.###.###sure you're welcome.
48436:38	###.###um, so do you have a personal computer.###.###uh, well we do have one in, in our home, uh,###it's on the fritz right now, because the monitor isn't working properly###but, uh, it has been, uh, used --n400231 tremendously, mostly by my children for, uh, playing games.###.###oh.###.###however, um, you know, the bane of our existence these days,	###.###yeah,###that's what,
48440:69	###it's on the fritz right now, because the monitor isn't working properly###but, uh, it has been, uh, used --n400231 tremendously, mostly by my children for, uh, playing games.###.###oh.###.###however, um, you know, the bane of our existence these days,###uh, but it does have a word processing program, which all of us have used --n400449 for re-, reports and papers and that sort of thing.###.###yeah,###that's what,	###and i haven't used it since i got out of college,###and that was six years ago,###.
48545:27	###.###.###well, i know there, there's got --n4023f6 to be a lot of uses,###but it's just y-, you have, --n40250a to have a need.###.###you have --n4025d8 to make yourself do it,###yeah.###.###yeah,###but you have --n40269a to have a need.	###.###yeah.###.
48574:109	###yeah,###yeah.###.###they're great for playing games.###.###right.###.###my brother,###.###well, my son is, uh, studying electronic technology,	###.###yeah.###.
48619:18	###.###and i always,###.###yes,###you can do wonderful design.### it, it's really, s-,###well, especially when anyone who --n403736's ever done any kind of drafting or engineering w-, uh, dr-, drawing --n403785, um,###you have --n4038cb to be so precise.###.###yeah,	###.###yeah.###.
48660:16	###yes,### it was a big change.###.###yeah.###.###you couldn't really wear a coat because it was so hot,###and then, again, i picked up a cold.###.###right.###.	###.###well, that's good.###.
48674:53	###so i don't, i don't even know how much, um, personal computers cost --n4043e8 nowadays.###.###well, they vary tremendously.###um, because you can get###because you're, they're, uh,###the ones that --n404609 were made --n404618 a few years ago, uh, have come down in price significantly, um,### you can get them, i've seen them for five, and six hundred dollars,###but they're much less, um, have much less memory, and capable, of much less.###.###yeah,	###.###.###no,
48768:11	###yeah.###.###.###and she could have bought a typewriter also.###.###yeah,###a typewriter with memory would, would have been fine,###.###yeah,###.	###.###yeah.###.
48810:7	###she goes, here, this is, you make your file,###and then you can, uh, edit it.###right.###.###.###um, i used the one, the one at work a lot, um,###matter of fact, anything i've had --n406f76 to write --n406f85 from now on, i had --n406fa4 to ca-,###god forbid,###write a couple of resumes,###and i was just great,	###.###uh-huh.###.
48844:9	###yeah,###well, bye.###.###uh, bye-bye.###.###.###i guess i don-, don't really have a problem with capital punishment.###i'm not really sure what the exact, uh, specifications are --n400131 for texas.###i know that they, uh, have capital punishment for certain crimes,###and that's probably the way i feel --n40029f about it is, is, uh, it kind of depends on the crime that --n4002e6's committed --n4002f5.	###but i don't,### seems --n400698 to be a lot of controversy about that.###.
48985:129	### it's just, it's, it's ridiculous.###.### she, she's an emotional victim.###.###.###yeah.###yeah,### it, it's terrible, you know###and,###.	###.###yeah.###.
48995:70	###and, you know, the, like you say, the cops that --n405531 are out --n405540 doing the work, day by day have got --n40556b to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work, basically go out the window --n4055ba.###.###yeah.###.###.###oh, that,###.###.###oh, man, i, i couldn't be a cop for that, for that very reason, you know, because they do.### the, the criminal gets right back out	###.###yes,###they are.
49114:39	###.###.###so i,###.### it, it sounds like,###i mean, from the way you described it --n401b4c a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand.###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, dallas is a very marked up area,	###.###uh-huh.###.
49246:39	###uh-huh.###.###but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same.###so i, i think most of them are###there was,###it,###like most areas that --n403eaa are built --n403eb9, um, there were probably, like two or three styles you could choose from --n403f08.###.###right.###.	###.###well, the housing here in maryland --n404219 is just atrocious. and in, in the entire d c area.### i'm, i'm only about, uh, twelve miles or so from the, uh, border of washington d c, and montgomery county,
49431:35	###yeah.###.###i love it though.###i love hondas.###.###yeah.###it,###.###i think i found my car.###.	###they're, they're in good spots###.###right.
49538:7	###it is me too###that's why i got the honda --n401f0e.###.###yeah.###.###hondas have great resale value.###.###yeah.###.###the mazda definitely did not.	###they're worse than american cars i think or just as bad as far as resale goes.###.###i did pretty well with my, uh, regal because it was in really good shape
49547:17	###the mazda definitely did not.###not at all.###they're worse than american cars i think or just as bad as far as resale goes.###.###i did pretty well with my, uh, regal because it was in really good shape###but, it still looked real nice,###.###yeah.###.### the, the interior was still really nice,	###.###right.###.
49629:16	###and i, bought it --n403895 loaded.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###oh, yeah.###i have --n40395c to have them --n40396f loaded,###.###oh,###.	###but they're so wonderful.###.###yeah.
49725:24	###.###well, and even if they didn't, you can still get a good idea from a, if you can get a good mechanic to, check it over real carefully and check the block and everything.###.###yeah.###.###.###that's true.###.###so.###.	###.###okay.###well, i enjoyed --n405706 talking to you.
49909:34	###my brain is really working well tonight.###.###that's okay,###they, um, um,###i've got a friend that, uh, --n403684 lives right next to the cowboys' training camp.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, uh, he gets, he sees them out --n4037a3 running a lot###and every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys	###.###uh-huh.###.
49955:61	###yeah.###.###okay.###yeah,###i enjoyed that because it was against the skins.###.###well, you don't, uh, you don't like the skins.###.###um, no.### i, i, i live near baltimore	###.###oh, okay.###.
49983:32	###well, of course,###.###.###yeah.###oh, yeah.###yeah, um,###of course, then you're not that far from philadelphia.###.###yeah,### i've, i've never liked ph-, philadelphia, the city a whole lot.	###.###oh, okay.###i,
50095:22	###the colts still, you know, still to me are the baltimore colts.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know.###.###yeah.###they really ought --n408052 to change the name i think --n408075 in indianapolis.###i, uh, never been real thrilled with, well,###not, you know,	### i, uh, i went to purdue university for a couple of years and, uh, really learned --n408308 to hate indianapolis while i was out there.###.###oh, okay.
50101:95	###yeah.###they really ought --n408052 to change the name i think --n408075 in indianapolis.###i, uh, never been real thrilled with, well,###not, you know,### sitting here and talking about all the cities that i hate --n408223,### i, uh, i went to purdue university for a couple of years and, uh, really learned --n408308 to hate indianapolis while i was out there.###.###oh, okay.###.###.	###.###jeez.###yeah,
50127:15	###but it's close to philadelphia and baltimore,###.###yeah,###.###so it's,###.###that's true.###i take it you're an east coast type guy. plus the west, coast,###right..###.	###.###.###well, what do you think --n40002a about it.
50192:48	###it has nothing to do --n401551 with us.###.###uh-huh.###.###and until he starts --n401609 doing something so inhumane that the u n gets involved, then it's nobody's business.###.###that's right.###.###um,###.	###.###all the time.###i mean, yeah,
50192:58	###it has nothing to do --n401551 with us.###.###uh-huh.###.###and until he starts --n401609 doing something so inhumane that the u n gets involved, then it's nobody's business.###.###that's right.###.###um,###.	###.###all the time.###i mean, yeah,
50212:95	###.###yeah,### and it's certainly, and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years.###.###yeah.###.###and it's going --n401c73 to continue.###.###that's right.###.	###.###yeah,###that's absolutely right.
50497:46	###.###and the only reason he came here --n406f29 was because the education is so much better for those who --n406f5c will go after it.###.###right.###.###he has no intention of going back to the philippines because there's no jobs.###.###sure,###okay.###.	###i mean we've got loads of foreign students###.###uh-huh.
50549:5	###.###i don't know.###i don't know what the answer is --n408004.###it's far beyond me.###.###yeah,###that's for sure.### that's, that's the way things have gotten --n408150.###.###yeah,	###.###yeah.###.
50630:74	###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###yeah,### i, i can imagine.###.###and, uh,###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
50630:94	###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###yeah,### i, i can imagine.###.###and, uh,###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
50652:13	###.###that's right.###.###at an opportune time i got one that, that --n409b61 suited my needs###and i've just stuck with it.###the only thing i've done --n409c9d to it is just add a, uh, add a mouse and a hard drive.###.###okay,###yeah.###.	###of course, i'm limited on memory now because i've got the low line.###i got the model twenty-five.###.
50803:34	###yeah,###.###because,###.###now i had a lot of friends who --n402ccc went to the peace corps, uh, back in the mid sixties###.###uh-huh.###.###and it really did seem --n402df5 to be a worthwhile organization,###but on the other hand, i'm not sure what the permanent value of it was --n402ebe.	###.###uh-huh.###.
50923:47	###well, on this subject of invasion of privacy,###yes,###it --n4000b2's very easy for anybody to find out about you.###your,###.###well, i don't really like that very much.###.###yeah,###uh, the special on channel thirteen that --n400251 was broadcast --n400260, i think --n400273, last week or so ago, it detailed how this one person went about --n4002b6 finding out this particular pers-, from this particular person his home mortgage, how much he pays --n400305 for it, what his payments are --n400328, uh, his, uh, social security number, driver's license, any kind of records he may have --n40038b. uh, their credit card and the status of their credit --n4003c2.###.	###.###it was just as a demonstration --n40081b to show those who --n400832 were watching it how easily obtainable information --n400855 is --n400860 on any single person.###.
50942:32	###oh, yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###that was the primary subject.###that's how they obtain information about segments of society and group them into age brackets, uh, their habits, their hobbies, their income --n400bb0.###.###um.###.	###.###well, that, that's not really good.###i don't know,
50961:14	###something that i feel --n401049 is a, is a, pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that --n4010a4's really so common that it's accepted --n4010cb as the norm now, is the op-, the open office concept.###.###the open office.###.###uh-huh,###where they have the, you know, the little partition dividers, throughout a, a large room --n40139c###.###yeah.###.### and, and people have little cubicles.	###but you don't really have any privacy at all.###.###not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody, i suppose --n401628, because it, you can easily be overhear-, overheard --n401667

51013:81	###there are no cubicles.###there's nothing --n4023a3 to block anything.###.###um.###.###so, yeah,###but, um, i guess we're changing ever so rapidly --n40249f in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained --n4024ce from anybody's record,###.###yeah.###.	###and it appears in front of them,###.###uh-huh.

51071:51	###.###uh-huh.###.###well, they take, they take my name, which --n403c50 is a very common name,###and my last name is even more common###.###uh-huh.###.###and they they check that name against, uh, their list###and they find several.	###.###so you've received a lot of, uh, flack.###.
51091:23	###they're so lazy.###they're just not doing it.###i mean they just find your name###and they match it up.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, and that just drives me crazy because they're,###and then they want,###then, you know, --n4044b9 to get it removed --n4044d0 they say, well, you know, --n4044fb you have --n40450a to write this, write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them, you know,	###and i'm like, baloney.###.###uh-huh.
51169:18	###oh###.###um,###.###how way back##, i mean###.###like, um, late fifties, early sixties.###.###okay	###.###what's that --n4002af.###.
51174:16	##, i mean###.###like, um, late fifties, early sixties.###.###okay###so wally moon moon shots and all that.###.###what's that --n4002af.###.###yeah,	###.###yeah.###.
51265:5	###of course, get a guy like cecil fielder, you know,###if he strikes out a lot, so what.###.###yeah,###well, i mean, with detroit, i mean, they can get away with one guy like that.###i mean, if i, if i were in detroit, i would start --n402085 building the team around fielder.###.###oh, yeah.###.###but that doesn't mean get three other guys who --n4021f7 hit,	###.###right.###.
51281:32	###.###so.###.###well, i think the key for, for l a this year is whether oral herschiser can come back.###.###i think the pitching's deep enough that it doesn't matter.###.###it may be.###.### i, i like them a lot.	###um, and, and, i mean, by --n4027b7 saying i like them, i like their chances.### i, i actually don't like the dodgers,###i'm a giants fan from way back.
51340:58	###um, the, the team i live and die with --n403173 actually is the red sox,### mostly die,###but, um, i go to the orioles since they're here,###and i, you know, i do enjoy them.###.###yeah.###.###um, i've had an opening day on monday.###.###yeah,	###.###mumblex how far is houston --n40367e.###.
51500:32	### they, they go f-, uh, year-round, uh teach them.###.###huh.###.###now, in the summer they have like a lot of field trips.###.###yeah.###.###there's a field trip just about every day if they want --n4014a5 to go on one, and stuff like that.###it's a lot more lax.	###.###what kind of questions --n4016db did you ask --n4016ee about the private sitter before you took her over there.###.
51584:28	###.###uh-huh.###yeah.###.###and, uh, i live in garland.###.###.###and, there's this montessori school that --n403153's nearby###and, um, it had been recommended --n4031eb by some friends of ours###but, uh, it, it's an older place.	###and then i checked that place out###and, uh, even though it was older, it was, it was real comfortable and, i guess, kind of homey.###.
51593:21	###but, uh, it, it's an older place.###and so, i, uh, checked out all the new places that --n403355 were near us###and then i checked that place out###and, uh, even though it was older, it was, it was real comfortable and, i guess, kind of homey.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.	###like, i noticed a lot of these other schools that i went and interviewed on, or interviewed at --n4036df, um, they did a lot of play work and stuff.###and then they,###almost all of them had a montessori section.
51596:7	###and, uh, even though it was older, it was, it was real comfortable and, i guess, kind of homey.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###and they didn't just play all day long. you know,###like, i noticed a lot of these other schools that i went and interviewed on, or interviewed at --n4036df, um, they did a lot of play work and stuff.###and then they,	###.###huh.###.
51775:37	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###and it --n40655a's hard to get them out,###and a lot of parents have places to go --n40661c and and things like that.###.###that's right.###.###and it's late at night,	###but,###.###is that where the,
51785:6	###so, you know, now it doesn't bother me at all###but,###.###is that where the,###over there off of, like,###i'm not sure what the street is --n406936,###is it off of, near country club,###.###yeah.###.	###.###sixty-six.###that one that --n406a96's, set --n406aa9 back in the woods.
51872:11	###.###but, you know, i, that,###.###.###i didn't base everything on that.###.###.###mumblex.###.###no,	###.###that's right.###that's exactly right.
52029:56	###.###so i haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater###but i rent probably four or five movies a week.###.###really,###i used --n4003ce to do that too,###but i haven't been doing it lately###but,###.###we've got a good video place out here	###uh, oh, air america.###.###no,
52099:19	###but i guess,###.###oh, well i hope i don't run across them.###.###really,###that's true because,###i don't know,###i just didn't find that one to be real,### i, i just thought it was too far fetched.###.	###.###um, oh gosh, i don-, i can't think off my head.###do you know which one yours was --n401930.
52113:35	###.### i, i have --n4019a2 to say that probably the one movie that --n4019c9 really threw me back the most, uh, that i was really the most in shock with --n401a18 was probably, uh, star wars.###.###oh, yeah,###well that's,###.###when that first came out --n401c57, i really did not expect the special effects or anything like that.###.###right.###.	###i was ready --n401efa to go back and see it again, you know###.###really.
52120:34	###.###right.###.###i mean, i guess, uh, out of all the movies, i've, i've never been as excited --n401dc0 to go back.###i was ready --n401efa to go back and see it again, you know###.###really.###yeah,###yeah,###you're right about that,	###i mean, i don't think anybody, anything could ever beat that.###.###now, i, i also liked, uh, oh, gone with the wind or some of the classic, like the lawrence of arabia.
52195:15	###it is.###.###okay,###i may have --n403275 to do that. go --n403290 see it,###or go --n403336 rent it.###.###and, a lot of times, what i wind up --n4033ba doing --n4033c5 is, picking say an actor or an actress, and seeing like all,###.###yeah.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
52195:39	###it is.###.###okay,###i may have --n403275 to do that. go --n403290 see it,###or go --n403336 rent it.###.###and, a lot of times, what i wind up --n4033ba doing --n4033c5 is, picking say an actor or an actress, and seeing like all,###.###yeah.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
52199:54	###or go --n403336 rent it.###.###and, a lot of times, what i wind up --n4033ba doing --n4033c5 is, picking say an actor or an actress, and seeing like all,###.###yeah.###.###i've seen all of james dean's movies. uh, all of mae west's movies.###.###uh-huh.###.	###i guess you could do that, you know, get all of david carradine's movies, or, uh, uh, segal,###.###uh-huh.
52200:42	###.###and, a lot of times, what i wind up --n4033ba doing --n4033c5 is, picking say an actor or an actress, and seeing like all,###.###yeah.###.###i've seen all of james dean's movies. uh, all of mae west's movies.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, just kind of, kind of go out and, uh, rent all the movies and, uh, uh, you know, just kind of go,	###.###uh-huh.###.
52231:12	###god, i can't even remember the name.###he said well, he wouldn't really talk about it.### didn't want --n403f5d to talk about him because he didn't think he was such a, uh, a good action guy.###.###huh.###.###it wasn't stallone,###it was, uh,###i can't remember.###shoot, i can't remember the guy's name.	###.###oh, see, i didn't really care, that's, that's one side of the action i guess that i didn't really care for --n40431b###but see i don't really like sylvester stallone.
52258:29	###i guess like i say, i just have,###i don't know,###i just have never seen any interest in him,###but.###.###no,### we, we actually rent, uh, probably a go-, good combination of movies with the exception of horror films.###.###oh.###.	###.###yeah,###i don't either.
52323:15	###well that's probably true.###but it was a very good movie.###it was done --n405e8f real well too.###i mean there wasn't any part of it that you really felt like, no, --n405f32 this can't happen.### it seemed re-, it seemed real,###you know it was really good.###.###yeah.###.### that, that was one, i mean	###but it was good,###it was really good.###.
52423:26	###.###right,###that's probably true,###that's probably true.### it's, it's very, very good.###very good.###.###yeah.###.###that's another one that,	###.###well my wife, uh, has got a, uh, a picture from kevin costner###and he signed it.
52454:20	###oh, yeah,###it's really worth it.###i mean it's a very good movie###and yes, i would suggest seeing it at the theater.###i know that they're still playing it###and they pushed it back, to --n408181 playing it in the theaters until like august,###.###huh.###.###i, think because they were, they were scheduling a video release of it in july	###so.###but, yeah,###that one is definitely worth seeing,
52468:18	###it's really good.###.###now did you see, uh, driving miss daisy.###.###yeah,###and you know, i didn't think that one was near as good.###.###okay.###.###you know, i guess it was okay,	###but, um, when i compare like the winners of this year and last year --n408808, it just,###i don't know.###maybe, it's, it's not,
52509:28	### i don-, i don't think our prison system isn't set --n400994 up, where we, um, rehabilitate, or, you know, restore anybody --n4009db.###.###.###i think it'll only make them worse,###but, i, i believe that god can come in and change a person's heart and genuinely change it,###but, that doesn't negate that you do reap what you sow --n400d07.###and if you do kill a person and it is, you know, you're found --n400de3 to be guilty, i believe --n400e06 god establishes the authority of our court system###and i believe that, you know, that i do believe that capital punishment is, uh, alternative.###even, you know, god can still change your heart###but that doesn't mean,	###but you still have --n40133f to pay your visa bill.###.### that's, that's right.
52560:18	###punishment.###.### thank you,###i'm sorry,###i just got home from work###and i'm just kind of spaced out a little bit.###.###yeah,###that's okay.###.	###i agree with you that, that, a person's heart can be changed --n40275b,###.###uh-huh.
52606:30	###.###.###that's correct.###.### he, under the law he would be stoned --n403577,###so we've been removed --n403614 from the law, of un-, from --n40363b being under the law###but we're still, you know, we're still accountable to it.###we don't need --n403812 to back talk,###but, you know, it's like god changes your heart to not do that.###he changes your heart not to look upon a woman in lust.	###but in the new, he's looking at your heart###and so, i guess that's what, what i mean --n403be5 by their character changes###and, you know, what i mean --n403cdc, it's like looking beyond what they're doing --n403d0f and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart --n403d42, what's the character showing me --n403d65 here.
52624:79	###.###i believe crimes against children --n404338 should be punished --n40434b bu-, by, by death. i believe, sexual crimes, unless there's a true change of character.###.###i tend --n404529 to agree on that, very strongly.###.###and that's where we just have --n4045cf to, to trust the authorities --n4045ee.###and they're not going --n4046c4 to excuse people, if it was, was run --n4046f3 like that,###i don't,###there would probably be very few exceptions to that###and if it was done --n4048a2 quickly and done --n4048b5 swiftly	###.###plus the, all the judicial system is overloaded with, all kinds of, um, problems, and crimes and so forth and then all of the, um, civil things that --n404b79 clog the courts,###.
52626:18	###.###i tend --n404529 to agree on that, very strongly.###.###and that's where we just have --n4045cf to, to trust the authorities --n4045ee.###and they're not going --n4046c4 to excuse people, if it was, was run --n4046f3 like that,###i don't,###there would probably be very few exceptions to that###and if it was done --n4048a2 quickly and done --n4048b5 swiftly### and, but it's not, because the judicial system has rejected, they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have --n4049a1, pretty much.###.	###.###right.###.
52626:43	###.###i tend --n404529 to agree on that, very strongly.###.###and that's where we just have --n4045cf to, to trust the authorities --n4045ee.###and they're not going --n4046c4 to excuse people, if it was, was run --n4046f3 like that,###i don't,###there would probably be very few exceptions to that###and if it was done --n4048a2 quickly and done --n4048b5 swiftly### and, but it's not, because the judicial system has rejected, they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have --n4049a1, pretty much.###.	###.###right.###.

52685:7	###but, i know that they have like, uh, their, crime rate,###it's not jamaica, i don't think --n405f45,###i can't remember which,###it's, uh, one of the caribbean islands### and, and they, singapore, is it like that.###my husband's going singapore.###and they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law###and the law is enforced --n406274.###and that's what, wh-, when you have lawlessness --n4062f0,###i mean the law's not being enforced --n4063d2	### we were, we went on a mission trip to manhattan and to the bronx and stuff, two years ago,###and all these kids were up on there --n406607 getting arrested --n406616 for crack###and everyone was out,
52687:6	###i can't remember which,###it's, uh, one of the caribbean islands### and, and they, singapore, is it like that.###my husband's going singapore.###and they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law###and the law is enforced --n406274.###and that's what, wh-, when you have lawlessness --n4062f0,###i mean the law's not being enforced --n4063d2###and all that does --n40644a is lawlessness.### we were, we went on a mission trip to manhattan and to the bronx and stuff, two years ago,	###and everyone was out,###uh, we were across from that big bus station,###i forget what you call it --n406779,
52718:184	###i don't know,###i guess, i'm kind of frustrated that, you know, we've gotten away from the christian basis that our court system was founded --n4071ca upon --n4071d5.###i mean, it reeks of the bible, just, the whole thing, the whole system.###and, so i feel like if that was presented --n407410 more openly, and not just relying upon, and para-church ministry --n407457 to come in and do it, that, that the system itself,### you know, you know what i mean --n40763d.###.###yeah.###.###i feel like that might be better, if it was run --n40771f on a more scriptural basis, which --n407742 would include, you know, you know, and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with.###.	###.###.###right.
52829:17	###oh, the kids love it.###.###i know.###.###i mean, they just love it.###it --n4013ba's wonderful for them to be outside.###.###i know,### and then they, and they, you know,###there's no t v,	###and they have --n4015df to use sticks and rocks and stuff like, that --n401612 to play with --n401625.###.###exactly.
52856:48	###yeah.###.###yeah.###and,###.### we, we try --n4019ec to, uh, go with another couple that --n401a17 have children also.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, that makes it a lot more enjoyable.	###we kind of split it up.###uh,###.
52863:88	###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, that makes it a lot more enjoyable.###plus, you know, we don't have --n401bce to go out and buy all the equipment and stuff, you know,###we kind of split it up.###uh,###.###good planning.###.###yeah.	###.###exactly.###.

53785:101	### and, but even then they're skimming over,###they're very, tri-, almost trivial with it.###.###yeah,###oh, yes.###definitely,###i agree.###yeah,###there's,###.	###they were great men,###and they're the father of the country and all this.###he had just as much dirt --n40320f on him as anybody else.
53787:29	###.###yeah,###oh, yes.###definitely,###i agree.###yeah,###there's,###.###you know, i mean, if they really wanted --n402f29 to get to the meat of the matter, i mean, there's, they make all these people out --n402f84 to be, oh,###they were great men,	###he had just as much dirt --n40320f on him as anybody else.###.###.
54024:7	###uh-huh.###.###but nothing steady.###just when i get some spare time here and there --n40160f i'll work on it,###but, you know, it's nothing that i, can really,###.###it's not, like you sit and knit every night.###.###.###no.	###.###yeah.###i don't even know how to knit --n401891
54028:36	###but, you know, it's nothing that i, can really,###.###it's not, like you sit and knit every night.###.###.###no.###not at all.###.###yeah.###i don't even know how to knit --n401891	###.###uh-huh.###.
54149:48	###and there's so many different problems there.###uh, what do you want --n4005b1 to concentrate on --n4005c4.###.###it doesn't matter to me.###.###well, uh, i'll tell you something,###um, i, i have a sister-in-law from israel,###.###uh-huh.###.	### they, they believe that they, they belong there###and they've belonged there forever,###and, the palestinians and the arabs are, uh, more or less,
54177:29	###but, i didn't really talk about that with her.### she, um, um, my sister-in-law now lives in, um, switzerland.###.###oh.###.###but, um, when they were living in israel --n4011b2, it was, it was,### the, the palestinians, they, they come in###an, and they're, they're nothing but really servants for them,###and they really treat them like second class citizens.### they, they don't really want them around	###.###uh-huh.###.
54187:49	###but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such.###.###uh-huh.###.###but they, they really do,###they look down on them.###and, i don't know,### being,### i, i live in, uh, vermont###and --n40180b being up here we pretty much treat everybody, you know, as someone that --n40184e has merit, even if they're poor, or if they're hispanic or if they're black.	###.###uh-huh.###.
54187:60	###but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such.###.###uh-huh.###.###but they, they really do,###they look down on them.###and, i don't know,### being,### i, i live in, uh, vermont###and --n40180b being up here we pretty much treat everybody, you know, as someone that --n40184e has merit, even if they're poor, or if they're hispanic or if they're black.	###.###uh-huh.###.
54194:33	### being,### i, i live in, uh, vermont###and --n40180b being up here we pretty much treat everybody, you know, as someone that --n40184e has merit, even if they're poor, or if they're hispanic or if they're black.###we give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we don't see all the crime and, all the hurt in the big cities, you know.###.###uh-huh.###.### i-, if i lived in washington, d c i think --n401bc4 i'd have a different attitude about black people###because i've heard that it, it, the, they're terrible, you know,###it's just like it's a dog eat dog world.	###and they're, they don't, you know, they don't go out and abuse drugs###and they, they send their kids to school###and they, they, they uh, you know really encourage them to go to college and stuff.
54228:16	###yeah,###but i heard that sa-, san antonio, unlike like, like a city like san diego it se-, it just has a really bad problem.###.###i grew up outside of houston###and i don't think, uh, as far as gang violence and things, i don't think --n402c2d it's any worse --n402c44 here than in houston.###.###yeah,###like say houston.### now i would, now me not even knowing anything about houston, i would think that it's a pretty calm city.###.	###.###no, huh,###there's a lot of crime.
54436:49	###.###i thought it was very well done --n4004fd.###.###yeah,###i, um,###.###how about ghost.###.### we, we saw,###an, we liked it	###.###right,###i feel the same way about that too.
54477:26	###.###yeah,###that was good.###.###and never seen, i've never seen casablanca and never seen gone with the wind.###.###i think i've seen most of humphrey bogart's movies, but, in, in, you know a long time ago,###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###oh, i, i def-,###we saw part of the african queen on, on t v a couple of years ago,
54486:67	###.###and, uh, like the maltese falcon and all those, uh, uh,###.###oh, i, i def-,###we saw part of the african queen on, on t v a couple of years ago,###.###yeah,###that was good,###yeah.###.	###but we just, you know, we walk into the video store###and we're like well why don't we go --n401bad see this now --n401bc0,###so.
54647:53	###.###it was good,###but i mean, he was, um,###.###when you think of what it takes --n404275 to make some of those kind of movies --n4042a0, you know.###.###yeah.###.###you see it for, uh, you know a couple of hours or an hour###and it really,	###.###oh, yeah,###oh.
54828:3	###he was in, uh, uh, honey don't shrink the kids, wasn't he.###.###no,###no,###you're thinking of rick moranis.###he looks like rick moranis###but he's not.###.###oh, okay,###se-,	###yeah,###that's the one i was thinking of --n40793e.###but i have, i've seen quite a few movies,
54927:46	###that was good,###i liked rainman, too.###.###yeah,###well i'm,###-n409980 being from baltimore, of course, i'm a big barry levinson fan since, uh, he, he's, you know, he's done a bunch of baltimore movies.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, n-,	###.###yeah,###they sound familiar.
54945:30	###.###uh-huh.###.###next thing you know --n409f4c, it's, it's###especially if there's commercial in it.###.###ye-,###we-,###.###and then the titles might sound familiar	###.###ye-,###of the three of those, diner's probably the best.
54949:38	###especially if there's commercial in it.###.###ye-,###we-,###.###and then the titles might sound familiar###but i really don't know what they're all about --n40a143.###.###ye-,###of the three of those, diner's probably the best.	###but diner is really worth seeing.###.###is that the one set in the fifties, or sixties.
55125:7	###.###uh, that's a good question.###uh, i'm figuring either one either the eagles or possibly san francisco###i'm not real sure.###.###boy, they'd some big changes, speaking of them.###.###they did.###so, i don't know how these changes are going --n404696 to help or hinder the team --n4046b5,###sometimes it brings in new motivation	###.###yeah.###i'm sure, you know, my sentimental favorite would have --n40490d to be philadelphia,
55184:12	###we've been --n40551f trying --n40552a get this new d n b two thousand printer up and running.###.###has it been, uh, snowing up there.###.###oh, boy i was just up there,###i just got back last night around eleven thirty or so,###and it was about seven inches of snow on the ground.###.###wow.###.	###.###well, that will make the skiers happy.###.
55251:11	###um, uh-huh.###.###in granada, in october, twenty-fifth, eighty-three, we invaded the place.###sure there were cuban soldiers there,###but there was also a bunch of russian advisors that --n4011d2 were damn good shots.###the team i was with --n40129b, we jumped in on the western tip of, of the island down on point salinas.###and for every cuban there was at least five russian advisors.###.###huh.###.	###in eighty-four, i was down in central america, as an advisor to the honduran army.###again we were running up against cubans --n4015f6 quite a bit, plus soviet advisors.###and the equipment we were capturing and taking --n4016c5 from the nicaraguans, was brand new, out of the crate, soviet made material.
55329:66	###have you,###i take it you haven't spent any time in the military.###.###no,###i haven't.###.###as a civilian that --n403a3f's never been attached --n403a56 to any form of the military, i know a lot of this stuff that i was involved in --n403aad, never did make the newspapers.###.###uh-huh.###.	###didn't it --n403d98 bug you a little bit why they kept --n403dbf coming up with all this stuff --n403dde.###.###you mean in the, in the most recent conflict.
55330:52	###i take it you haven't spent any time in the military.###.###no,###i haven't.###.###as a civilian that --n403a3f's never been attached --n403a56 to any form of the military, i know a lot of this stuff that i was involved in --n403aad, never did make the newspapers.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, during that same time frame, didn't you get some feeling, that, i mean, they're getting all these weapons and stuff.	###.###you mean in the, in the most recent conflict.###.
55343:8	###.###in any of them since eighty-one.###.###oh. yeah,###definitely.### i, i'm, i'm a little bit shocked to what the u s has done --n404047 in terms of --n40405a selling to iraq in the past ten to fifteen years.###yeah,###i think we, we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too.###it's bad enough that the soviets do it.###.	###it's a matter of money, to a certain extent.###.###um.
55361:11	###the deal the iraqis have --n40451c with the russians was for oil.###.###yeah.###it --n4045e1's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons. especially when it's to the south of us --n404648.###.###uh, the ones to the south are more regional conflict.###they're not really that worried about invading north.###they're more interested in,###they've got a screwed up situation,###i'll give them that.	###the situation down there is weird###and it's very screwed up.###.
55368:54	###they're more interested in,###they've got a screwed up situation,###i'll give them that.###from mexico all the way down into cen-, central and south america.###the situation down there is weird###and it's very screwed up.###.###uh-huh.###.###inflation is out of this world	###and generally the people, are getting screwed --n404c80,###.###.
55487:20	###but i still don't like other people watching me.###.###i like --n401ade to be able --n401af1 to sweat, have my hair a mess. uh, feel that, okay fine, if my bathing suit slips a little bit i don't have --n401b6c to be conscious of it being a little bit too low.###.###yeah.###.###.###right.###.###and i, my bathing suit's just one piece,	###but i don't have --n401e8f to be conscious of what i'm doing --n401eb6 or how i'm doing it --n401ed5.###.###uh-huh.
55638:28	###so i mean, it's your choice where you want --n404ad5 to go --n404ae4,###but, i enjoyed it higher.###.###did you ever,###.###.###well, i'm sorry.###.###that's okay.###.	###did you ever try that.###.### i have a, i have a bad back,
55714:16	###yeah.###i mean, when you go in there --n405f3b, they wouldn't make you do theirs. would they.###.###oh, no,###they have nothing --n406092 to do --n4060a1 with that.###.###okay.###.### see i joined, uh, when this one down here opened up --n406181, i joined as a v i p.###and the v i p gives you, uh, oh, gives you a diet, a computerized diet.	###and they show you how, everything to do --n406478, and how to do it --n40649b, and the whole nine yards.###so it became part of the package,###so i went through it.
55714:25	###yeah.###i mean, when you go in there --n405f3b, they wouldn't make you do theirs. would they.###.###oh, no,###they have nothing --n406092 to do --n4060a1 with that.###.###okay.###.### see i joined, uh, when this one down here opened up --n406181, i joined as a v i p.###and the v i p gives you, uh, oh, gives you a diet, a computerized diet.	###and they show you how, everything to do --n406478, and how to do it --n40649b, and the whole nine yards.###so it became part of the package,###so i went through it.
55730:76	###but they have packages where they just offer the exercise program --n4066f5.###is that what you're saying --n406793.###.###oh, yeah.###you can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too.###.###i see,###okay.###.###i just went and took the, because they were offering it as an opening benefit,	###.###um.###.
55734:65	###you can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too.###.###i see,###okay.###.###i just went and took the, because they were offering it as an opening benefit,###so it was, it's less than what you pay --n406a32 now for --n406a41 going in there, after all this time.###.###um.###.	###.###um.###.
55738:12	###.###i just went and took the, because they were offering it as an opening benefit,###so it was, it's less than what you pay --n406a32 now for --n406a41 going in there, after all this time.###.###um.###.###so it's like when i got laid off --n406ba9 --n406bb0, i went back in there, and start all over again because it had been a while since i'd done it.###.###um.###.	###so it's kind of nice.###.###wow.
55822:11	###it would depend upon which one you want --n4086ea.###i think now that i've had the bicycle, i would go to the stepper.###but if i were you, i would go --n40886c apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while.###because you can buy a month's membership. and see what you feel --n4089e1 is best for you.###.###oh, really.###.###.###um.###.	###because i jump on the bike here at home.###mine has its,### see, the handle bars go up and down,
55851:48	###right.###uh, who --n40016c wants --n400177 to start this one.###.###em-,###i don't know,### i've been, i've been sitting here --n40027e thinking,###yeah,###because it was, you know, took a couple tries before i found somebody.###well, you know, i'm like, i'm not really sure what i think --n400475 about this.###um, uh, i mean, the first thing is, the uh, if it's going --n4005c2 to be mandatory, it's got --n4005e5 to be mandatory,	###.###right,###right.
55851:90	###right.###uh, who --n40016c wants --n400177 to start this one.###.###em-,###i don't know,### i've been, i've been sitting here --n40027e thinking,###yeah,###because it was, you know, took a couple tries before i found somebody.###well, you know, i'm like, i'm not really sure what i think --n400475 about this.###um, uh, i mean, the first thing is, the uh, if it's going --n4005c2 to be mandatory, it's got --n4005e5 to be mandatory,	###.###right,###right.
55886:25	###but i, i felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone, or go into a military situation, that they could help the country in other ways. be it cleaning out, uh, lots, in, in their neighborhood or, whatever kind of community or public service --n40148d might be available.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i guess i see that as, as not so much a demand but, but a privilege.### it's, it's kind of, uh, uh, it's something,###.###it is, uh,###.### it's, it's	###i just see that as maybe a good idea.###i wouldn't mind --n401c49 doing it at forty-four.###.
55897:86	###i just see that as maybe a good idea.###i wouldn't mind --n401c49 doing it at forty-four.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, and i find ways --n401cfa to, to turn some of that back to, to others --n401d3d.###uh, and i, i guess i, i can't see that as --n401ea2 being something to really object to --n401ec9.###.###well, i guess it would still depend on how,###i mean, if, if you're talking about any-, if you're talking about something that --n40211b's like a full time, you know, one year full time, you know, this is what you do --n40217a, you know.	###i mean, i, you know, i don't know.###.###i could see a, a full, a run-, a gamut of different kinds of opportunities.
55930:41	###and we got some great public works out of it.###but, um, i don't see that as --n4030c6 being necessary now.###i can see it being done --n403170, uh, on a regular schedule.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, everybody has --n40323c to put in so many hours of, uh, public service in a given time, perhaps.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and i, i don't see it just relegated --n40346e to the young.###but i see, i, i see so much --n403555 going on that, that --n403570's bad.###and this would give them a chance --n4036a7 to have some positive self-esteem.
55967:122	###.###right.###.###.###yeah.###.### it's, it almost needs --n404179 to be something that --n404190 has more impact for the individual, on going.###.###yeah.###.	###.###oh, that would, be a nightmare.###.
56087:79	###and, i see that as being, i, i see that as --n40729b being a, a, a change, uh, for the positive. kind of along the same line as, as, as the mandatory thing.###.###yeah.### and but then they lost, too much business.###.###.###it's just, thing, a part of everyone's consciousness.###.###uh-huh.###well, the thing about that is though, it's got a,	### and, you know, and then it kind of just went out of vogue.###and i, i'm worried that it, it might, you know, it'll, it, the same thing will happen.###it's like, you know, environmentalism was really big for a couple of years
56097:24	###i mean because it was, i mean it was big, you remember, like in the early seventies and all that.### and, you know, and then it kind of just went out of vogue.###and i, i'm worried that it, it might, you know, it'll, it, the same thing will happen.###it's like, you know, environmentalism was really big for a couple of years###and then people like, well, you know,###i'd ruther, rather spend, you know, fifty cents less on, uh, on, on such and such, you know,###and even if it's not environmentally safe, who --n407f3a cares, you know.###.###i'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way.###uh, there have been too many other things that it's done that for --n4080b7, just in my life.	###.###yeah.###.
56120:31	###.### that's, that's right, because,###.###of course, that's probably blasphemy for you to say --n408cbc, uh, --n408ccf coming from where you are --n408cea in texas.###.###uh, no,###no,###because if, we,###what was it --n408e9e, seventy-four when we had the, the last last oil crisis --n408ee1.###and, uh, we started --n408fdc getting smart	###.###uh-huh.###.
56318:16	###.###i see.###.###and, uh, you just set it in there,###and you microwave it on high for seven minutes,###and you turn it one time.###.###uh-huh.###.###and while that's cooking, i take mayonnaise, about a cup of mayonnaise, and a teaspoon of mustard, and some garlic powder,	###and i shred up some just regular white cheese.###.###uh-huh.
56325:79	###uh-huh.###.###and while that's cooking, i take mayonnaise, about a cup of mayonnaise, and a teaspoon of mustard, and some garlic powder,###and i mix it all together.###and i shred up some just regular white cheese.###.###uh-huh.###.###and after that's cooked --n402513, you take it out and pour this on top of it,###and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that.	###.###uh-huh.###.
56349:25	###but it, it looks,###i mean, what you can do --n4029b3 then, see is, like what i usually do --n4029e2 is, i'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle,###and then i put the, uh, shrimp around the outside of it, you know, on my platter.###.###um, um.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and then i have a green salad that i put --n402ce5 around the outside of that.	###and then i just fix little individual cups for them.###and they have the, garlic bread,###.
56638:20	###yeah.###.### i, i, in fact i was in texas for a little while.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i liked, uh, the barbecues and the mexican food.###.###uh-huh.###.	###because i have been brought --n407778 up mostly italian american food.###because my, uh, parents are italian and portuguese.###so we cook a lot of pasta, and, uh, gravies, and pizzas, and, you know, roasts, and that kind of thing.
56656:33	###.###well, have you ever thought about --n407b31 coming to louisiana, you know, --n407b54 to visit.###.###i would love --n407c24 to.###.###yeah.###you ought, --n407ca8 to come down.###.###i,###.	###.###really.###.
56812:42	###.###uh, and, you know, now we're,###and that was whatever, ten years ago###and now we're up to proposition a hundred and fifty or something like that.###i mean, we've just,###there were apparently voters who --n401b24 just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were asked, being asked --n401b6f --n401b76 to make decisions on topics that --n401b95 would have three different competing proposals###and you had --n401d55 to vote for, you know, yes or no on each of them###and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them###and it was incredibly complicated and difficult.###and a lot of people revolted against that,	###.###.###you know, that's, that's, that's why we hire people who, uh, you know, --n402106 to, to make these decisions for us --n40212d.
57046:227	###.###that's right.###.###um, so, gosh,###so we don't have a great solution yet do we,###.### don't have a great### i, i think i checked that as a question i'd be willing --n4077c9 to discuss --n4077d8 too.###oh.###.	###.###no,###no,
57091:25	###.###yeah,###well, i, i mean, i feel that, i feel that wa-,###.###i think they're looking after their own self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country.###.###yeah,###well their job is to be reelected --n40940c, by in large,###and, so they work on that job.###and there's also an antigovernment mood in the country, you know, where government is misspending your dollars --n409558	###and you know, throw, throw the bastards out,###that kind of thing.###.
57154:74	###you really don't want --n401510 to dress up unless you, you, uh, have a job and you have --n401557 to be there right after school or something like that,###so.###.###right.###like where i work --n40172e, it's, it's pretty casual, uh,### it's, it's, i guess it's more like a, a college campus###also, i mean there's hundre-, you know, hundreds of people --n4019b3 work for t i.###.###yeah.###.	###and they dress up like when customers are coming in --n401c43, or, uh, when we have department meetings or something like that --n401c82.###.###.
57158:235	###like where i work --n40172e, it's, it's pretty casual, uh,### it's, it's, i guess it's more like a, a college campus###also, i mean there's hundre-, you know, hundreds of people --n4019b3 work for t i.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, a lot of people just, just wear jeans and, and, uh, sweats all the time###and they dress up like when customers are coming in --n401c43, or, uh, when we have department meetings or something like that --n401c82.###.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.

57324:59	###uh, uh, a little simple shell, shell blouse, you know, that you can make --n405ae3 for about, say ten dollars at, you know, at, at the most out of a decent fabric, boy, runs you like twenty something dollars in the store.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah it's, it's marked --n405daf up.###.###just a little shell --n405e53 to go under a suit, you know.###.### it is, it is really outrageous	###i never understood this then,###but i do now,###but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that --n40617f had come out that --n406196 were thirty dollars,
57469:64	###yeah,###i had a similar thing, that i've worked on cars ever since i was, uh, a kid.###and that was some time ago,###but i've gotten to the point where, uh, the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on --n4006a0 that, uh, oh, most of the cars### i buy, i try --n400813 to buy as simple a car as possible.###.###yeah,###i know what you mean --n40091a.###.###so, you know, changing the oil, changing the spark plugs	###.###yeah,###or fuel injected,
57518:18	###yeah,###i used --n40176f to have, uh, ch-, chevy van,###it was a short van, that --n40183e had the, the three fifty in it.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and basically it, it was a motor	###.###right.###.
57531:38	###.###and you could get to it --n401a8a to work on it.###.###yeah,###i had --n401b39 to change the water pump in that, here about a year ago.###and it was really fairly easy.### take the grill out and the radiator out###and you can just stand there and work on it.###.###yeah,	###.###well that's true.###you're right, you know,
57536:30	###and it was really fairly easy.### take the grill out and the radiator out###and you can just stand there and work on it.###.###yeah,###the hardest part about, uh, water pump changes is getting all the junk off, before you can get too it.###.###well that's true.###you're right, you know,###by the time you've finally got down to it --n401f91,	###.###well that's kind of the way i was --n40211b,###i tried --n4021a6 to remember --n4021b5 as i took stuff off where it went --n4021dc,
57540:63	###yeah,###the hardest part about, uh, water pump changes is getting all the junk off, before you can get too it.###.###well that's true.###you're right, you know,###by the time you've finally got down to it --n401f91,###i was hoping i could remember where all those other things went --n40205b.###.###well that's kind of the way i was --n40211b,###i tried --n4021a6 to remember --n4021b5 as i took stuff off where it went --n4021dc,	###.###a few years ago i had an oldsmobile diesel###and, uh, the,
57577:26	###.###well that's true.###.###and, uh,.###.###i think the onl-, closest thing i've come --n402f1c to, to a diesel is, i've worked for a tractor repair shop, uh, when i was in high school --n402f87###and, uh, we used --n40312f to overhaul farm tractors basically,###.###yeah.###.	###but as far as cars i've never, never been involved with them.###.###well the injector nozzle and stuff in, you know, the big diesel farm tractors, you know, what --n40336c are about the size of your thumb, and the-,
57655:29	###yeah###co-,###.###.###uh-huh.###.###i'm convinced that the small v eight like the, the mustang's original two eighty-nine or some of the chevy two eighty-threes, were good little v eight engines that --n404c14 were not gas guzzlers###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah.###.
57688:28	### and, and it was normally carbureted --n4059fe###and it's fairly easy to work with --n405a90 because there's not just a whole lot in it --n405ac3 to go wrong,######and you know changing the plugs and stuff.###.###yeah,###that's kind of like,###.###.### the, the first, well my first car was a fifty-six mustang	###i had a, uh, dodge pickup several years ago,###and, uh, i can't remember the size of the engine###it was a three oh, seven or something like that,
57707:43	###and there was basically nothing in there but an engine, and a few things.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###now, you open the hood###and it's scary.###.###yeah.###.	###.###the friend of ours over here, he's got, uh, sixty-five, or sixty-six mustang the six cylinder.###.
57750:74	###.###and he says well, hopefully i won't have --n406de5 to change them, before i trade it off.###yeah,###it's going --n406ef7 to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved --n406f2e right up against the fire wall.###.###yeah.###.###so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them.###.###yeah.	###like well, actually, i guess --n407485, her-,###within a couple of years ago anyway was the last i've paid any attention to it --n407550.###the three oh five was that, that, v eight that they put --n40765f in the, the three quarter and, and half ton van.
57757:13	###so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them.###.###yeah.###well when they went to the, started with the newer engines --n40717d, you know, when they started --n4071a0 putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines --n4071cf is where they started --n4071e6 getting into so much, you know, trouble --n407211. because the three fifty with all the, you know,###like well, actually, i guess --n407485, her-,###within a couple of years ago anyway was the last i've paid any attention to it --n407550.###the three oh five was that, that, v eight that they put --n40765f in the, the three quarter and, and half ton van.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###.
57757:65	###so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them.###.###yeah.###well when they went to the, started with the newer engines --n40717d, you know, when they started --n4071a0 putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines --n4071cf is where they started --n4071e6 getting into so much, you know, trouble --n407211. because the three fifty with all the, you know,###like well, actually, i guess --n407485, her-,###within a couple of years ago anyway was the last i've paid any attention to it --n407550.###the three oh five was that, that, v eight that they put --n40765f in the, the three quarter and, and half ton van.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###.

58093:83	###right.###.###i just remember, oh yeah, our guys are over there###and it's sad###and we shouldn't be fighting a war###but there was no, let's support them, you know.###.###right,###we-,###the,	###.###yeah.###.
58158:119	###.### giving a soapbox to stand on --n407e3f.###.###yeah.###.###but, well, i just, i, i'm glad we've learned.###i'm sorry we had the experience of vietnam.###.###yeah.###.	###because, you know until the la-, past four or five years, nobody ever really worried about that, for them.###.###that's true.
58180:19	###.###so, i don't know.###well, do you have anything else you want --n4086fd to say --n40870c on this.###.###no,###i guess not.###.###i think this is the first time that i haven't been cut --n40885c off by the computer --n408873.###.###i know,	###.###usually i can talk all day###but this is something --n408a58 to me that --n408a6b's sad.
58182:16	###well, do you have anything else you want --n4086fd to say --n40870c on this.###.###no,###i guess not.###.###i think this is the first time that i haven't been cut --n40885c off by the computer --n408873.###.###i know,###we get cut --n40897a off all the time, too.###.	###but this is something --n408a58 to me that --n408a6b's sad.###.###yeah,
58220:45	###because, uh,###.###to use you mean --n400384,###uh-huh.###.###yeah,### if, if somebody ha-, is totally unfamiliar with it, uh, human nature being what it is --n400461 we don't like --n400478 to change.###.###yes.###.	###.###yes.###.
58273:9	###the other one must be for someone else.###.###that's right.###.###uh, i don't know,###i mean even britain has converted over###and we inherited this mess from them###and, uh,###.###that's right,	###.###well, i mean, it's more --n401cf1 our fault than theirs at this point because they, they saw the light, um,###i don't know why they we-, um, were more able than we were --n401e7f
58292:16	###.###that's true,### that's, that's probably true###and america does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting, you know, some other model.###.###there's an expression for that,###with eyes on the past, backing confidently into the future.###.###i've never heard that one,###that's very nice.	###and i think,###i guess, my feeling is the way to do it --n40284e is, is to just start --n402871 giving weights, you know, have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers, er, just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and, uh, just have people start --n402928 using it rather than having people constantly trying --n40294f to convert.### remember me getting a package of something that --n402c6e said one pound,
58324:20	### i, i think that would be the easiest way###but human nature being such as it is, i would think it would take, probably, two or three years before people co-, could completely cut the cord.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###oh, oh, that's what i was thinking --n4038ba by quick transition,###i didn't mean, you know, i didn't mean like sweden going over to right hand drive or anything, you know,	###.###did they switch.###.
58364:9	###.###yeah.###.###.###i'm sure.###.###um, so i, i, i, i, i think it --n4044d6's essential that it's done###and i think the real trick is to avoid the you know,###a little more attention to human psychology###and, whereas, people want round numbers	###so they don't deal with thirty seconds of an inch###.###exactly,
58542:8	###oh my gosh,###speakeranan*t36-2.###.###i couldn't.###.###and then she makes noodles with, uh, with, s-, soy sauce or whatever,###.###yeah.###.###speakera40-1*t40-1.	###speakerbnan*t40-1.###speakerb40-2*t40-2.###boy, i couldn't do that,
58703:51	###speakera78-1*t78-1.###plenty of good red meat.###speakerbnan*t78-1.###speakerb78-2*t78-2.###yeah,###yeah,###speakeranan*t78-2.###.###yeah.###.	###.###oh, my gosh.###.
58821:9	###and i'm not really that great at it###so it just turned out --n40552a to be too much of a, too much, too much cooking.###.###speakerb105-1*t105-1.###so, well, i guess i'll let you get back to --n40569d feeding your little one there.###speakeranan*t105-1.###speakera105-2*t105-2.###no, uh,###speakerbnan*t105-2.###speakera106-1*t106-1.	###speakerbnan*t106-1.###speakerb106-2*t106-2.###he's set,
58838:24	###speakeranan*t107-1.###speakera107-2*t107-2.###yeah,###yeah,###speakerbnan*t107-2.###speakera108-1*t108-1.###i set him down.###speakerbnan*t108-1.###speakerb108-2*t108-2.###okay.	###speakeranan*t108-2.###speakerb109-1*t109-1.###or do you, do you get into that's, that,
58875:62	###and, um, the sticky buns, of course, would last, you know three or four days###speakerbnan*t115-2.###speakera116-1*t116-1.###and that would be it.###speakerbnan*t116-1.###speakerb116-2*t116-2.###yeah,###then be gone.###i know,###that's the thing about baking.	###and i, i can do a pretty good pie,###we have this pie crust recipe --n4062bc in our family that my grandmother gave my mother --n4062e7###speakeranan*t116-2.
58947:15	###it tasted pretty good, really.###speakerbnan*t130-1.###speakerb130-2*t130-2.###yeah,###speakeranan*t130-2.###speakerb131-1*t131-1.###oh yeah.###speakeranan*t131-1.###speakera131-2*t131-2.###but, uh, it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad --n407024	###speakerbnan*t131-2.###speakera132-1*t132-1.###but.
59067:46	###yeah,###speakeranan*t150-2.###.###yeah.###.###speakera152-1*t152-1.###i think that's why they call me because they want --n4080ef to get people outside the state --n40810e, you know.###speakerbnan*t152-1.###speakerb152-2*t152-2.###yes	###well gee, my husband is from richmond###and i went to u v a,###speakeranan*t152-2.
59180:44	###well, uh, the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so.###.###oh, yeah.###.###um, i think a lot of it has --n4001ab to do with women working.###.###uh-huh,###yeah,###i do too.###i think it's going --n4002fb to,	###.###yeah.###.
59282:11	###.###they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that,###that helps out,###but still, it cost a lot.###.###oh, yeah,###i mean, just the, you know, the cost of living###and loans don't pay for groceries and stuff.###.###right,	###and the books are outrageous. i mean, absolutely outrageous,###.###oh, i know,
59333:26	###and you work,###.###yeah.###.###because if you have two or three kids, by the, e-, way the inflation's going --n403c94 i think a woman's always going --n403cbb to have --n403cca to work###and it's just going --n403e4f to be an accepted thing.###there isn't going --n403ee4 to be any of this, you know,###very few people will ever stay home.###.###yeah,	###.###yeah.###.

59340:57	###very few people will ever stay home.###.###yeah,### and, and that's all right with me, because i don't want --n40405a to stay home###.###yeah.###.###you know, i think i'm just part of tha-, the new stuff, that --n40418f is just,###i don't know, i think i would just go nuts --n4042d3 sitting at home all day long.###.	###.###yeah.###.
59344:22	###.###yeah.###.###you know, i think i'm just part of tha-, the new stuff, that --n40418f is just,###i don't know, i think i would just go nuts --n4042d3 sitting at home all day long.###.###well you know, i can't imagine how i did --n4043f1, because now i work all the time,###.###yeah.###.	###and, um, i can't imagine how i stayed home --n404599.###.###yeah.
59466:29	###steve's mom finally, uh, finally s-, you know, said that, that god will take care of us when it's our time --n407587.###.###right.###.### she finally admitted, you know, she finally told me it's okay if you don't,###but it --n407849 took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very, very old fashioned family.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, she stayed home and raised her kids	###and, i was raised --n407cc9 totally opposite.###how we got together --n407d31, i don't know --n407d4c,### but. because my mother had six girls,
59514:31	###but, i'm older.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, i got --n40891a to stay home with my kids, which i really wanted --n40894d to do --n40895c,###but now i could not go back and do it.###.###yeah.###.###i really couldn't,	###and i mean, i did stuff###but, to me it feels like i must have done nothing.###.
59531:43	###.###yeah,###i think so.###.###but, uh,###.###i think it would be neat if, if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you --n408f1f.###.###well you know more and more of them are,###i don't know if it is up there where you are --n40917f	###.###uh-huh.###.
59539:65	###well you know more and more of them are,###i don't know if it is up there where you are --n40917f###but where i am --n40922c, the, just like all the hospitals, they're getting day care.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###are they.###.###but the reason they had --n409392 to do this --n4093a5 was because so many people, you know, so many women could not afford,	###.###right.###.
59557:39	###yeah,###i don't know if the t i in dallas does or not.### i know, i know nobody around here does, it,### we're, it's too small around here.###.###oh really.###.###yeah.###.###.	### i, uh, i've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control###and, uh, i must say that there are a couple of arguments against, uh, strong gun control which i find --n400236 very compelling, although most the people who --n40025d argue gun control with me i find, uh, --n400290 use sort of canned arguments, you know, sort of the n r a slogan arguments###and, um, uh, see i've been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it --n400538.
59665:22	###but if you're not a, if you're not a basically good citizen,###you just told me that you're going --n402cc3 to get one of those guns anyway.###.### if, if they want the firepower they can get it.###.###so why hav-,###.###because it doesn't matter how restrictive your border control points are --n402eba###they'll get it across the border one way or the other.###.	###.###uh, okay.### let-,
59698:66	###well, that makes a lot of since to me.###i mean, i certainly feel that if, if, we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm --n403aa7###but, uh, i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do, use it safely --n403c24 as someone learns how to drive --n403c47, if not more so.###.###well, the han-, in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly --n403e54 as the weapon, as a, as a pistol.###.###yeah.###.###.###well, i have a bicycle	###well, i'm still, i'm still puzzled though,###what --n404207 is the argument,###how does the argument work if, uh, if the bad guys are going --n404296 to have guns anyway --n4042ad.
59713:200	###basically, the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going --n404479 to get the guns anyway###they're not going --n404570 to take those courses.### is it, uh, is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns.###.###well there's,###.###if it's not going --n404736 to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going --n404765 to at least raise the prices###does that, uh, mean advantage.###.###uh, not necessarily a price thing.	###.###uh-huh.###.
59739:6	###san francisco, bay area.###.###okay.###.###.###okay.###you've been to the city.###.###uh-huh.###.	###someone attempts --n404fcf to mug me i would ju-,###i would,###as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we're equally matched --n4050cf because i can meet him blade for blade.
59778:22	###.###.###well,###.###if i'm, mumblex at the same, time.###.### i'm, i'm sure,###.###.###i'm sure	###.###.###if i walk into a bad neighborhood i'm sure i'd want --n405bba to walk through with you because i'm sure you have good, you know, fa-, far above the average instinct for how to use guns --n405c45 and how to use them effectively --n405c68 and everything.
59783:19	###.### i'm, i'm sure,###.###.###i'm sure### given all, given all your training i'm sure that, you know, you'd,###.###.###if i walk into a bad neighborhood i'm sure i'd want --n405bba to walk through with you because i'm sure you have good, you know, fa-, far above the average instinct for how to use guns --n405c45 and how to use them effectively --n405c68 and everything.###um, i'm, quite concerned that if you let everyone --n405f1a hasn't yet used a gun in a, haven't, hasn't yet committed a felony,	###in this sort of wild west scenario, you're going --n4061b2 to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature.###you're going --n4062e3 to start --n4062f2 getting a lot of gunfire.### it's, it --n4063b0's hard for me to imagine that a, a situation of, you know, take it to a logical extreme, if everyone walking around --n40642f carrying a guns you're not going --n406452 to have an increase in gunfire.
59835:5	###.###yeah.###well, uh, that, that was the topic.###.###what, i consider --n40750f gun control is being able --n40752e to hit my target with the first shot.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###say a person, uh, uh, get,	###and say i've got the vibes, this guy's fixing --n40777d to do something,###i go ahead and pull my piece.###.
59891:20	###yeah.###.###uh, i think we're getting to the point --n400bcd now where they're going --n400be8 to eventually let it be, um, majority vote --n400c17.###and that's not going --n400d50 to be good.###.###i don't like that,###no,###.###no.###.	###i know my husband served on a, on a jury a few months ago up here in denton,###but, uh, it was a guy, it was, it was a drug conviction###and i don't remember
59920:23	### and, and they ended up,###the jury, you know, decided, hey, it's time to crackdown here --n4019bb, you know,###and it was time to do this drug thing --n401ae5###and let's crackdown###and let's really,###and they sentenced him to fifteen years, you know, which they thought first offense, okay, this is, they thought that that was, --n401c85 that was a good thing.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they sentencing him to fifteen years	###and they were told --n402176 that, uh, he would probably serve three, of the fifteen, and that he had three previous convictions.###.###uh-huh.
59928:58	###.###and they sentencing him to fifteen years###and, um, after it was all over, uh, the jud-, they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers,, let me come over in just a second, okay, and sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers###and they were told --n402176 that, uh, he would probably serve three, of the fifteen, and that he had three previous convictions.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###oh, yeah.###.
60030:24	###.###yeah.###.###and, we will continue --n4041e2 funding you for the next two years,###after two years we'll cut it down seven to seventy fiv-, you know, seventy-five percent.###.###uh-huh.###.###and after another year we'll cut it fifty percent,###and in five years, it sh-,	###.###sure.###.
60084:22	###.###i think we should try it, like you say,###.###yeah.###.###if it doesn't work, we can always come back,###but i think it would be a good idea to try it.###.###i do too.###.	###.###well, good.###.
60120:57	###uh-huh.###.###so, i mean, i'm used, i'm used to --n400373 having cats around,###i like them.###.###yeah,###i like --n4004af having ca-, cats around or pets around in general### i, i favor dogs over cats actually###but,###.	###.###oh, i'm, i'm a dog person.###i had,

61344:22	###.###okay,###this is really ironic that this would, i would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away.###.###oh, no.###.###and it's just been tearing me up all day.###.###oh, i bet.###.	###we've been to the pound,###we've been to the humane society,###we've been to the adoption center,
61348:16	###oh, no.###.###and it's just been tearing me up all day.###.###oh, i bet.###.###because we have just been looking all over for him.###we've been to the pound,###we've been to the humane society,###we've been to the adoption center,	###we've been calling neighbors.###so this is just really strange.###.
61453:22	###but,###.###how do they get along together --n401ac9.###.###pretty good.###uh, we've, we had the, the dog first,###and, uh, she's kind of a wimp### and, and the cat kind of rules,###.###.	### he, we had another cat about two years ago.###it got leukemia, feline leukemia###so we had --n401ea8 to have it put --n401ebf to sleep,

61505:27	###i don't know,###this is just so hard.###.###oh, i know it has --n402a38 to be.###.### it's just, it's like i said,###we've had him for two years###and he's never,###i mean, he's, he's gotten out,###but he's always been right there.	###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.
61520:89	###you know, he's just always been right there when he gets out --n402e1e.###.###oh.###.###you know, it's the first time he's ever been gone like this --n402f25.###.###oh, that's really too bad,###that's awful,###well,###.	###and i knew we were going --n403255 to find him, you know,###and when we didn't --n403325 it was, like, oh, no,.###so i don't know.
61607:55	###yeah,###isn't it, though.###.###i know,###.###that's,###.###it's very strange###but,###.	###and when he's not right at the door in the morning --n404d19 i really worry that something's happened to him, that somebody, he's got in a fight or, you know, somebody's hit him### and, and uh, if he doesn't come by mid morning, then i really get scared.###but he's always come back eventually
61722:82	###and then we get home at night we do bring him in.###.###you have a fenced yard or,###.###uh-huh,###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah.###the backyard, it's really big --n407370, too, for him to run in --n40739b and stuff.	###.###yeah.###.
62035:11	###.###uh-huh.###.###it's a big magazine,###it's twelve inches acro-, narrow, the narrow side and seventeen inches the tall side###.###oh, wow.###.###and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages.###but the book is, the magazine is full of these mail order, computer mail-order houses	###.###uh-huh.###.
62066:10	###.###uh-huh.###.###you'll notice that in that it's, it's a, it's a, although it's a magazine it's large.###and like i said it's about an inch thick.###.###uh-huh,###well, getting back to the p c --s,###i'll tell you,###i ya,	###.###.###and secondly, i did learn this much about computers,
62268:44	###.###yeah,###i think that is an excellent program,###i really do.###i like that.###and it's, it's beneficial to the small towns too because, they really, really have, have a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand --n402245 because we're in the metroplex.###.###yeah.###.###.	###yeah.###.###right,
62324:121	###.###right.###yeah.###.###and, yes,###you're right,###i think it's a sixties program.###i think it was one of kennedy's hot points that he,###that was his big deal.###.	###.###right.###right.
62401:52	###right,###yeah.###.###um, and one of the quick examples is the aborigines.###.###yeah,###uh-huh.###.###uh, when we were in australia --n405424,, uh,###sad little things. uh, i felt sorry for them. because their society isn't there anymore,	###.###yeah.###.
62420:33	###but i don't think there's any way you could go, uh, the peace corps could go in and rescue those people --n40587e,###and i don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either.###.###yeah.###.###so, i, i'm wondering if the peace corps is, really an effective tool.###.###well,###.###.	###.###good point.###.
62540:32	###.###right.###.###.###okay,###i'm going --n400828 to let you kind of lead the pack, because you sound like you're,###.###.###i-,### let me tell you just a little bit about myself.	###but for the last four or five years i've had eye problem,###.###oh.
62573:9	###all right.### it, it'll come to us,###okay..###.###okay.###.###are you ready.###.###yeah.###.	###.###right.###.
62680:10	###my husband goes --n4034d4 to pick it up last week###and we couldn't go --n403567 get it sooner because i just had the baby,###and, you know, life's just a little bit complicated.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, he goes and gets it, brings it home,	###so you can't really test it out.###and then second thing, we still can't put the boards in, because they have other things blocking where we need --n403904 to do it --n403917.###.
63175:20	###.###yeah.###i'm the same way.###.###i feel good after i do it,###but i hate it when i'm doing it --n403f52.###.###yeah.###.###you know, i just,	###and she just loves it.###so. even when she doesn't go to the health club --n404124, she runs, you know.###.
63191:12	###and, it's a daily thing for her.###so, it, you know,###and it's so hard for me.###i envy her,###i wish i could be that way,###but i don't. i don't,###.###i do too.###.###and i have an older sister that --n4044d3 loves running, too,	###but at, to me, it's every minute's agony,###and i,###in fact, i don't run.
63303:43	###.###right.###.###there's no reason that we shouldn't do it --n4067b5,###but i don't know.###.###it --n406884's just hard to make yourself go.###and i, i think one thing i don't like --n40695e about aerobics is that after i'm finished it's kind of late at night,###and i've been sweaty,### and, and it, you know,	###.###yeah.###.
63439:7	###well, does it --n4097d3 cost money like to use the, to exercise in the weight room or to, uh, to tak-, to go swimming.###do you have --n4099d5 to pay for that, too.###.###yeah.###you can get a fitness membership that --n409a91 allows you to use the facilities,###and it's about eight dollars a month.###.###oh, that's not bad.###.###no,	###.###huh-uh.###.
63452:18	###.###pretty cheap.###.###um.###.###and then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership,###but, i think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced --n409d7a, from what i've heard --n409d99.###.###i think so too,###yeah.	###.###hm.###.
63456:11	###.###and then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership,###but, i think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced --n409d7a, from what i've heard --n409d99.###.###i think so too,###yeah.###well, and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics.###.###hm.###.	###.###oh, yeah,###in fact, uh, the t i-er's families can come in on these things,
63471:14	###.###okay,###the topic was, should the united states adopt the metric system,###and if so, should, uh.###.###how should they do it --n400128.###why didn't it work last time --n400194.###.###and why didn't it work last time --n40020a..###.	###.###yeah,###well, i, i am too.
63494:74	###one of them is where you just take whatever --n40080b's already standard --n40081e###and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter.###.###yeah,###yeah,###direct conversion.###.### i, i don't know.###uh.###.	###and you know, people if they have --n400d2b to are going --n400d42 to learn --n400d51 to think that way.###.###well don't most of them, doesn't just about everything now have both metric and english.
63550:53	###.###yeah.###oh.###.###i would expect people with any kind of buying power over the age, you know, under the age of thirty or so, to have some idea what it is --n40219f, anyway.###a liter's about a quart.###.### the, uh, i think maybe there's where the problem came in --n4023a8, you know.###we've tried --n4024ac to, instead of --n4024c3 learning,###it's kind of like learning a language, you know,	###.###yeah.###.
63575:8	###yeah,###i read that, what uganda and,###.###something.###i don't remember what the other one is --n402d46###but,###.###there's one or two others that --n402de7 just,###.###it's just time i think --n402e7c for, for us to go over.	###.###uh-huh.###.
63581:9	###.###there's one or two others that --n402de7 just,###.###it's just time i think --n402e7c for, for us to go over.###because all you end up --n402f84 doing --n402f8f is if you're in business or you're in any kind of international,###.###uh-huh.###.###i don't, you know,###i work for t i,	###you have --n403215 to perform this conversion anyway.###.### yeah, uh, i, yeah, i do, too.
63609:58	###.###right.###.###and then you end up with a decimal, where you start --n4037a8 getting into mils, and that sort of thing --n4037d3.###.###right.###.###and then some of them are done --n4038ec in, you know, purely metric.###.###yeah,	###and ours were in mils.###.###uh-huh.
63617:55	###.###yeah,###i remember that stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns --n403a21###and ours were in mils.###.###uh-huh.###.###and it got to, you know,###somewhere down the line they went standardized,###they went microns,	###.###yeah.###oh, i can imagine.
63667:37	###i would have more problem more problem with the temperature, except that, you know, --n404c19 working in engineering, we do everything in centigrade, or celsius.###.###.###well, i had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature, you know,###if it's between zero and ten, it's cold,###and if it's ten and twenty it's not too bad,###if it's between twenty and thirty it's pretty warm,###.###it's getting warm, right.###.	### so, but, uh. the big problem is not having the, uh, the resolution between temperature, you know, between a hundred, if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what, thirty, zero, you know thirty four degrees, whatever that is --n405228.###you know, you don't get all the little differences###.
63669:25	###.###well, i had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature, you know,###if it's between zero and ten, it's cold,###and if it's ten and twenty it's not too bad,###if it's between twenty and thirty it's pretty warm,###.###it's getting warm, right.###.###if it's more than thirty it's just hotter than all get out.### so, but, uh. the big problem is not having the, uh, the resolution between temperature, you know, between a hundred, if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what, thirty, zero, you know thirty four degrees, whatever that is --n405228.	###.###yeah,###it's about.
63751:53	###and most of the engine parts seem --n406ef4 to be s a e,###so. it's just crazy.###.###right.###it just gets bad,###now, you got --n40704b to, you got --n407062 to have one, and not mix them up.###.###yeah.###.###because you're never going --n407194 to get to one, one system if you still got a, got a mix.	###miles per hour to kilometers per hour, and the whole nine yards.###kind of hard to do --n4074ec gradually.###.
63784:13	###that'd sure seems like a long way.###.###yeah,###but they'd need, they'd seem --n407dbc to be ticking off faster, too.###.###yeah,###i guess that's it.###.###every road sign you come to --n407f3a, is like, well i don't know it that far.###.	###they could've converted it to metric just about as easy.###.###yeah,
63789:20	###yeah,###i guess that's it.###.###every road sign you come to --n407f3a, is like, well i don't know it that far.###.###well they converted all the road signs to fifty-five miles an hour, you know,###they could've converted it to metric just about as easy.###.###yeah,###i think they,	###yeah,###you still got cars on the road that --n4082d1 don't have both.###.
63798:6	###i think they,###you got the problem with all your cars are still,###yeah,###you still got cars on the road that --n4082d1 don't have both.###.###yeah.###.###at that time, anyway, that was still when things were,###the metric system was still not,###.	###.###you know, now cars, they have both.###sooner or later they'll start --n408565 putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start --n4085a8 thinking that way.
63822:86	###what kind of recycling programs do you have --n40005f in rowlett.###.###um, th-,###well right now they've got a, kind of a central location off of the main highway,###and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper, um, plastic, um, i think three bins for glass, white, green, and whatev-, whatever other combination there is --n400289.###.###.### and, and i think they've got a comp-, uh, some kind of container for aluminum.###.###plano's doing real good on that.	###.###uh-huh.###.
63831:19	###plano's doing real good on that.### they have, uh, they start off --n4005b9 putting out great big huge garbage cans. which we're supposed --n4005f0 to put all our week's garbage into --n400617 it,###.###uh-huh.###.###and of course it doesn't fit right now.###.###yeah.###.###but now we start in may, --n400830 breaking it down,	###.###um.###.
63914:247	###.###so they're really going at it,###and i think it's marvelous because,###.###yeah.### i, i guess rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is --n4027ec.###.###well,###.###and i think they're trying --n402903 to, to make some changes.	###.###uh-huh.###.
64096:9	###uh-huh.###.###but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger --n4077b3, it'll work a little bit more, too.###.###yeah.###.###.###true.###.###because it's,	###i just,###i really amazed --n407a23 to find out that, what is it --n407a4e, eighty per cent are filled --n407a75 now, in, in garbage fills.###in five years we're supposed --n407be0 to be at max.
64285:45	###.###oh, we always we always do though.###.###it --n40266e's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like --n4026a5.###.###.###yeah###.###uh, it,###.	###.###that's right,###and then we get all that heat.
64288:15	###it --n40266e's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like --n4026a5.###.###.###yeah###.###uh, it,###.### i wish, i just wish it wouldn't come all at once.###.###that's right,	###.### and, and. right.###.
64313:30	###yeah,###i live in garland.###.###oh, you got into that bad stuff.###.###yeah.###we got hail the size of marbles.###i mean, just so noisy hitting the house and the glass on the windows.###it didn't break anything,###but we went out there afterwards	###.###isn't that strange.###.
64351:32	###you don't think it's cold enough, you know to,###.###it's not on the ground,###but in the clouds it is.###.###right,### must be.###.###.###i guess,	###but maybe that's what --n403d13 rounds it, i don't know.###but, tumbling.###.
64364:21	###.###i was dumb.###i was in, um, florida for a week on business.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i had called back to the house.###i stayed the weekend,###and i called back to the house.###my housekeeper was baby-sitting my cats and dogs, said something to the effect of, now we've made the national news, don't get upset, and don't worry,	###i said, okay, you know###.###uh-huh.
64523:17	###.###southern california.###.###san diego.###.###i've lived in san diego --n406bec for six years when i was a ki-, younger --n406c1b, and l a area,###and my parents live in anaheim right now.### lived up north of los angeles in thousand oaks area, where the cowboys have their training camp --n406dd6,###or used --n406e95 to anyway.###.	###.###yeah.###.
64637:17	###.###right,###right.### i, i know exactly mumblex that area.###it's a nice area out there.###i love thousand oaks.###uh, texas, i don't know,### thing, things,###you just have less a variety, i guess --n408775.### i think, i don't think it's quite as green, you know.	###but it's just,###.###oh, it's green sometime.
64651:9	###.###yeah,###but it's just, you know,###i don't know.###.###well, it doesn't stay green, you know###.###right.###.###the really,	###i know this sounds like a texas story,###all honesty, you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here five years.###we haven't had a really bad one,
64653:4	###but it's just, you know,###i don't know.###.###well, it doesn't stay green, you know###.###right.###.###the really,###and in all honesty,###i know this sounds like a texas story,	###we haven't had a really bad one,###.###yeah
64718:63	###yep,###yep.###.###though i, i couldn't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says, this is bach --n400a55, you know.###.###oh.###yep,###yep.###.###.	### i just, i just know, when i hear it --n400d37 that i like it.###.###uh-huh.
64751:21	###i'm pretty much the same way.###you know, people always say, wow. th-, the meanings of those words.###.###yeah,###i know.###.###and i'm always, meaning.###there's wor-, well, you know,###.###.	###.###i know,###i know.
64806:38	###yeah,###mostly oldies.###.###yeah.###.###but classic rock, you know, with,### if, you know, like when the doors movie came out --n4022bf, you know, doors was really on the radio --n4022ee there, you know. where, you know, you'd hear was-, one or two of their more famous songs, maybe top forty in baltimore --n402369,###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###oh, yeah,###yeah.
64840:20	###yeah,### i never, i never, i didn't,###.###so,###.### i, i lived in pittsburgh before baltimore,###and i didn't, i never really noticed the difference when i moved to this area --n402cf3.###.###uh-huh.###.	###it just seemed the same.###.###yeah.
64885:96	###boy, that would really be beneficial.###.###so, yeah.###.###because you never hear the, you never hear the news basically on the radio.###i never get it.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.	###.###yep.###.
65444:76	###oh.###.###um, it's, it --n403878's funny he, um,### the, the novelization of star wars was list-,###you know, it, it was out in the, uh, in the stores as --n403a35 being by george lucas.###but it turns out that, uh, foster actually, uh, ghost wrote it for him.###.###is that right.###.### wh-, which, you know,	###.###is that right.###.
65461:27	###well, i, i've never read anything of his,###but i've heard about him.###but wouldn't you think he would,###does he get some royalties from that, hopefully.###.###oh, i'm sure he does.###.###well, i would think he would.###.###i'd hope so.	###.###oh, i'm sure he is,###i'm sure he is.
65552:38	###um, that's when i had the subscription --n40582e.###.###mumblex.###.###yeah,###it was a lot of fun.###.###yeah.###i li-,###i really enjoy that team.	###i used --n405a8f to live in iowa too,###and they have the iowa oaks.###and we used --n405b66 to go, go to their games all the time.
65555:45	###.###yeah,###it was a lot of fun.###.###yeah.###i li-,###i really enjoy that team.### i, we used --n4059dd to go there all the time.###i used --n405a8f to live in iowa too,###and they have the iowa oaks.	###and,###.###they don't exist anymore,
65727:4	###.###yeah.###.###because everything,###there's six flags right by the stadium,###there's a wet'n wild### and, and it, you know, that's,###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
65748:99	### that's, that's what i'd always heard --n4094e7,###i've, uh,###.###yeah.### we, you know, we, i like it there.###and i think dallas has enough --n4096f6 to offer --n40970d that they don't have --n409728 to hog everything.###so, i'm glad that they're staying in arlington.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah.###that's about what it takes me --n409ac2 --n409ac9 to get to memorial.
65805:19	###.###um. huh.###.###he's a basketball fan because he, he plays for the high school he goes to --n40aa40###and uh, just loves d-, dick vitelle, which not many people do --n40ab59.###.###.### so, but he's reading it,###and he's r-,###and he says, he's so interesting, mom.	###.###.###and he's really enjoying that.
65878:21	###.###you mean the prisons.###.###uh-huh.###they're already talking about it.###i mean, they're talking about, uh, having it, uh, as a, you know, business. uh, to, uh, you know, to, so, the, you know, the government doesn't have --n4006a9 to deal with it.###.###i hadn't heard that.###.###but, uh, yeah,	### so, or, uh, obviously.###.###right.
65917:6	###.###but again i'd like --n4019ef to see something on the other end back into education. but not in the education we have --n401a42 today.###so i'm lost on that one.###i would like --n401bb5 to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems. and to come up with something a little better than what we've got --n401c4c.###.###uh-huh.###yeah,###it --n401e15's tough to, to say what, uh, you know, what, uh,###as far as this, that good or bad or what.###but, uh, i was just talking to somebody else,	###they,###so, uh,###.
65917:25	###.###but again i'd like --n4019ef to see something on the other end back into education. but not in the education we have --n401a42 today.###so i'm lost on that one.###i would like --n401bb5 to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems. and to come up with something a little better than what we've got --n401c4c.###.###uh-huh.###yeah,###it --n401e15's tough to, to say what, uh, you know, what, uh,###as far as this, that good or bad or what.###but, uh, i was just talking to somebody else,	###they,###so, uh,###.
65988:7	###.###yes.###.###okay.###.###wow.###.###mumblex###yeah,###it was a cordless phone,	###so we had some interference,###so i changed that.###.
66121:10	###and then they, they give you, uh, uh, the credit limit,###and then you're always s-, seemingly up to that limit.###now i have quite a few credit cards that i'm always almost up to the limit on most of --n400c10 them.###and that's, that's how a lot of people get into trouble --n400d32.###.###yeah.### i've got, i've got two that i, you know, that usually i'll have a balance on --n400e78.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###.
66202:33	###well, they, they do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time.### ev-, ev-, everybody in the world will offer you a, a credit card.###.###it's like, let's see if we can get her to run up her bills.###.###.###but it's hard,###i mean, it's, it --n4030c1's tempting when you see something --n4030e0 to say," well, i'll just charge it."###and sometimes i'll do that,###but usually i, i will try --n4032ce to pay everything off the next month	###.###uh-huh.###.
66212:58	###or the ones that --n403388 usually have an outstanding balance all the time, i'll, i'll pay more than the minimum payment.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###just i fe-, i feel like even that little bit helps.###.###right.	### that's, that's why i've, i've really started --n403894 to try --n4038a3 to, to pay off mine and get out of debt --n4038d6.###because we never know when we might, you know, get laid --n403a9b off or something --n403aae.###.
66287:28	###and it's ruining their credit###and you really have --n404eff to watch it, this you know.###.###man.###.###because,###.###that's scary.###.###yeah.	### mo-, most of them do.###.###i didn't realize that.
66316:40	###right,###.###ooh,###.###right.###.###that's scary.###.###.###a-, a-,	###.###that's something i never thought about --n405a72 getting, you know, checking with --n405a95 --n405a9c to see what, what your credit report looked like --n405acb.###.
66438:50	###uh-huh.###.###and i changed my mind,###.###uh-huh.###.###but then they went ahead and charged it on my account.###.###oh.###.	###.###wow.###.
66560:39	###.###yeah,###yeah,###and there's, uh, there's a lot of people here in baltimore that, uh, --n40299a have###and we just had, uh, a real big cocaine bust,###and of course, you know, they're, they're playing it up --n402b60 real big that it was, looked like it was a very, very small ring###and they just happened --n402d0d to get lucky and catch the guy.###.###yeah.###.	###i think they've got over a hundred dead already this year.###.###last year it was d c,
66589:10	###and so they, you know,###society's not going --n4037f5 to put them to death,###well at least maybe the guy they cross --n4038a1 next time is going --n4038b8 to.###uh, i think, i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say, you know, this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society --n403a0e###and we are there by going --n403bad to remove them from society, not temporarily, but permanently.###.###yeah.###.###i mean, i, i personally think life imprisonment,###i don't think much of li-, of life imprisonment.	###but second, you know, why should we --n403ef0,###the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole.###well that means you're going --n404016 to put them in a cage
66701:23	###they've, decide the penalty separately from the verdict.###.###right.###and, uh, yeah everybody, everybody was pretty much, you know, let's burn him.###.###uh-huh.###.###and that's, you know, that's the way they wanted --n406ec7 to do it --n406eda.###and he was surprised because he thought there was going --n406ffe to be a problem because he, uh,###you know some people on the case were, were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges	###.###yeah,###well, you know, you just have --n40739c to decide, you know, wha-, yo-,
66788:5	###lawn,###it's a forty year old house,###.###so, we are doing a lot of refurbish work,###.###oh, my.###and yeah,###painting, lawn, gutters.###you name it,###.	###.###speakera8-1*t8-1.###i think that's considered --n4006f9 exercise whether you want it or not.
66831:17	###yeah.###.###and that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way,###.###speakerb19-1*t19-1.###right.###speakeranan*t19-1.###speakera19-2*t19-2.###but it's a lot. you know.###it's not too strenuous,	###but i don't know what i did --n400fe2 to my knee.###speakerbnan*t19-2.###.
66909:29	###.###well, we moved, we moved down to the north end of oak cliff in the castle park area.###.###speakera38-1*t38-1.###oh, really.###speakerbnan*t38-1.###speakerb38-2*t38-2.###yeah,###speakeranan*t38-2.###.	###.###speakera40-1*t40-1.###uh-huh.
66922:10	###uh-huh.###speakerbnan*t40-1.###speakerb40-2*t40-2.###and she lasted about two weeks,###and her ankles couldn't take it anymore.###she was used to --n401f68 running, you know flat tracks and whatnot,###and uh, ever since that, it's just been real difficult.###it's real aggravating, because she starts in###and her ankles will start --n402144 hurting again and stuff. even if she does get on flat ground,###so she's kind of in the same mode.	###and she just hasn't been able --n40240c to stick with the training schedule long enough --n402433 to really get back in shape.###and, when you want --n402536 to do it --n402549, it's really, really aggravating.###you know, it, it --n40261e's one thing to get motivated to start --n40264d doing the exercise,
66972:76	###yeah.###.###speakera50-1*t50-1.###it's depressing.###speakerbnan*t50-1.###speakerb50-2*t50-2.###uh-huh,###it is,###and you know, you, you don't spi-, well.### speaking for myself i don't sleep as well, when i am not exercising --n40306b,	### it, your body just gets used to it.###yeah,### i, i don't particularly enjoy it.
66978:91	###uh-huh,###it is,###and you know, you, you don't spi-, well.### speaking for myself i don't sleep as well, when i am not exercising --n40306b,###and uh, it's really, it --n403138's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff,### it, your body just gets used to it.###yeah,### i, i don't particularly enjoy it.###well i, i used --n4033e9 to lift weights an awful lot, and stuff like that.###i do enjoy --n4034e9 riding bike,	###but once i got used to it, it was habit forming.###it was,###i felt so bad if i didn't,
67108:27	###yeah.###.###speakera76-1*t76-1.###that is a gorgeous, gorgeous place.###speakerbnan*t76-1.###speakerb76-2*t76-2.###oh, it's, it's a lot of fun,###the people are great.###there too, we've got a real active neighborhood association.###and uh, we have, well, we've got four regular parties every year	###so, it's a lot of fun###and it is, it's a really beautiful area.###and some, some of the people, uh, some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too, are picking up some of those great big houses,
67183:9	###okay.###.###oh, wow.###.###and i just loved the neighborhood.###.###yeah.###and i mean, everyone, everyone had houses like that.###.###speakera98-1*t98-1.	###speakerbnan*t98-1.###speakerb98-2*t98-2.###uh-huh,
67207:9	###speakeranan*t100-2.###.###oh, i guess --n406341, it's twenty-eight by fifteen front porch.###.###oh.###next door, we've got an austin stone.###across the street, the guy,###it was burnt --n4064dc out about two years ago### and, and the guy moved in and completely redid### it's got, oh, it's got a rounded front on it.	###and he's, he's landscaped his yard###and he's about ready --n4067ac to put in a pool and things like that.###so, yeah,
67235:35	###i tell you what,###we got into the fitness center at methodist###and they have a quarter mile track there.###so she has started --n406c71 doing that rather than uh, rather than take off.###the problem is she's a school teacher###and for her, she can't run in the morning.###for her to get home and try --n406e6a to run at six o'clock in the night, in the winter time, it's starting --n406eb9 to get dark --n406ecc###and, you know, you don't want --n40701a to,###she doesn't want --n4070a9 to be out by herself anywhere in dallas.###regardless whether it's north dallas or whatnot, when she goes over to this fitness center --n40719c, it's fenced --n4071b3 in,	###speakeranan*t104-2.###speakerb105-1*t105-1.###so there's a lot of consideration.
67261:8	###but, i'm in plano.###speakerbnan*t107-2.###.###in west plano.###.###yeah.###.###and we live on one of those blocks that --n4075fc it's a neighborhood watch block.###.###uh-huh.	###.###and the street doesn't go anywhere.###.
67321:20	###that's right.###.###it --n40810f's a hard lesson to learn.###.###speakera134-1*t134-1.###there's only one crazy out there, you know, to make any difference.###speakerbnan*t134-1.###speakerb134-2*t134-2.###yeah,###yeah,	###speakeranan*t134-2.###.###well, you got the.
67374:82	###.### it, it, it varies.###uh, out near my house is pretty hilly.###uh, but sometimes i bike to work which --n400e13 is about, uh, a fifteen mile trip each way.###and that's mostly flat.###.###how long does that take you --n400f64 to get to work.###.###uh, about forty-five, fifty minutes.###.	###.###yeah,###it can be a pain.
67387:58	###it can be a pain.###uh, basically, uh, i work on a campus###so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the, uh, campus to the, uh, gym, use the shower there###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, but, it's, it's enough of a pain, that i did it consistently one year,###i would commute every day, uh,###but it just became such a pain.###i mean we're talking, you know, forty-five, fifty minutes for biking, uh, and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind.	###.###right.###.
67412:13	###uh-huh.###.###how about you,###what kind of biking do you do --n401f69.###.###uh, well, actually my wife just got me into it###and i did an, did an internship at the institute for aerobics research in dallas, the cooper clinic,###.###uh-huh.###.	###i was a solid weight trainer,###.###uh-huh.
67417:7	###uh, well, actually my wife just got me into it###and i did an, did an internship at the institute for aerobics research in dallas, the cooper clinic,###.###uh-huh.###.###and i learned all the health benefits of, you know,###i was a solid weight trainer,###.###uh-huh.###.	###and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need --n402372 to do it,###so, once i got into this, uh, internship, i learned all the physiological ad-, advan-, advantages to it,###.
67419:42	###.###uh-huh.###.###and i learned all the health benefits of, you know,###i was a solid weight trainer,###.###uh-huh.###.###and all i did --n4022a6 was weights and aerobic exercise###and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need --n402372 to do it,	###.###uh-huh.###.
67481:38	###.###uh-huh.###.###and i may do that sometime.###there again, i'm just kind of a fledgling into this.###.###uh-huh.###.### i've, it's kind of funny.###i called this number	###.###yeah,###yeah.
67502:19	###um.###.###bicycling is really big here.###i didn't know that, and, you know, until i came down here, and, kind of caught the fever.###.###wow.###.###.###yeah.###.	###and, you know, you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that, --n403efc or above the age of fifteen or something,###.###uh-huh.
67534:16	###.###uh-huh.###.###there are a lot of, a lot of resources, a lot of magazines, and stuff,###little texas bicyclist, is like a little newspaper that --n404836 comes out every month.###.###um.###.###it's free### just go to the bike shock, bi-, bike shop and pick it up,	###so i guess i'm going --n404ac7 to be busy about every saturday this summer, --n404af2 going to a different ride.###.###oh, that's terrific.
67552:68	###uh-huh.###.###so, uh, how long have you been biking --n404d46.###.###oh, i guess as an adult for just about the past, uh, three years or so.###uh, you know, i guess last time i did it --n404eb7 before that was college, which --n404ed6 was about ten years ago.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, yeah,	###and so i thought i'd try it, too.###.###have you ever had a, uh, it's kind of slightly off the subject, but you ever had a, uh, a blood workup done --n40530e recently or since you've been biking, to see if it,
67601:37	###you say you ride about a hundred, hundred fifty miles a week.###.###yeah.###.###man.### that's, that's hard-core.###.###on average,###yeah.###.	###what time of the year do you usually embark on your,###do you ride inside if you can't ride outside.###.
67644:76	### the main, the main thing, i guess, for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts --n406c47 seeming like, you know, exercise and a chore, i'll lay off it more.###.###right.###so you, uh, change up your routes a lot, and keep a...###.###oh, yeah,###yeah.###i try --n406f4e to go someplace pretty different, you know, every week.###i rotate around, uh, about four different routes, uh, from my house###or i'll sometimes come in the school.	###because it's just, it's along the erie canal up here.###.###so, what school is it --n4073c1.
67909:32	###right.###.###they're always, always happy.###i don't think i've ever seen them not look happy.###.###and she's so easy going and so sociable,###.###yeah.###.###you know, she loves everybody.	###.###right.###.
67937:20	###.### getting in,###yeah.###.###and, uh, this golden retriever jumped in the, the, really fast moving, uh, river current,###and, uh.###.###oh, no.###.###well no,	###he first jumped in###and i,### he's, he's just about a year old himself and never had really,
67968:27	###and up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now.###.###ugh,###ugh.###.###and i would not have been fun --n4052be trying --n4052c9 to retrieve her,###but, uh, this dog, dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do i do --n4053bc now, as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and, uh, actually paddled up against the current and, uh, made it back to the shore and climbed up###and then, he, he jumped in again,###.###.	###he loved it.###.###yeah,
68005:12	###.###yeah.###.###and she'd just lay there on that step and just, you know, cool off.###.###yeah,### i've, i live right across the street from a, a big lake here, um,###it's on oneida lake###and i'm wondering if, uh, if she'll want --n406234 to go out there and go --n406253 swimming next year.###i mean, i've got,	###so she doesn't run --n40642a loose,###but, uh, she could go in sometime when, if i'm watching her,###.
68078:47	###and i don-, i don't know how many times i've seen it --n407748.###.###uh-huh.###.###and it came on t v the other night###and i was watching it again,###and my husband heard me laughing###and he said i can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie.###.###i'll have --n407a3d to check it out.	###and it did look like it'd be a good mo-, movie,###but,###.
68105:54	###and so i travel a lot.###.###oh really.###.###and yeah,###i'm a engineer at, uh at the laboratory, rolm laboratory, griffis air force base, up here,###so.###.###oh.###.	###so.###.###uh-huh.
68129:11	###.###right,###.###.###that's it.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###really,	###.###no,###no.
68225:54	###and then, there was the black woman that, --n401fec uh, robbed and shot the furrier.###.###.###and she was set --n4020b0 free, too, just in two examples in texas recently.###.###uh-huh.###.###but she actually killed the furrier. or someone,###she was charged --n402216 with murder###and then, then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something.	###but i know what you're,###what if we make a mistake.###.
68236:48	###but i know what you're,###what if we make a mistake.###.###that's it.###.###and that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything --n4025a6.###.###uh-huh.###well, right now our laws are so liberal that, uh, even with the death penalty in effect, i don't think that, uh, --n4026f9 they're going --n40270c to use it, uh, too frequently, uh, unfortunately.###i, like you, say yes	###.###well, well, i guess, though, where i would have a problem with it if i were on the jury that, that, --n402ac3 put, that --n402ada handed down the death sentence because it --n402b01 was my judgement the person's guilty.###.
68309:74	###that's correct.###it is,###it is.###.###and, uh, uh, yes,###i'm inclined --n40498c to agree with you.###i think so,###there should be a limit as to the number of appeals.###.###now, there's some,	###.###um, um, well, n-, not just for dealing in drugs.###.
68380:11	###.###but it just touches so many young people.###um.###well, my children are about in the same age bracket.###.###oh, it does.###uh, i have four sons myself,###and the youngest is twenty-eight,###.###.	###and they all went through it, you know, going through high school and everything###and knock wood that, uh, they have not,###well i won't say they didn't try it, uh,
68381:10	###but it just touches so many young people.###um.###well, my children are about in the same age bracket.###.###oh, it does.###uh, i have four sons myself,###and the youngest is twenty-eight,###.###.###so they are all pretty well grown up	###and knock wood that, uh, they have not,###well i won't say they didn't try it, uh,###i wouldn't know,
68444:14	### he, he's very conscious of, of passive smoking###and he's concerned about it but, hasn't quite made it yet.###.### well, well, when i was still smoking --n4074d5, i, i felt that way.###.###.###if i was in a public restaurant, seated at table with, uh, non smokers i would try --n407624 to pick a s-, a, a my, seat where the smoke would blow away from them --n40768f.###or i'd hold the cigarette under the table.###.###yeah,	###yeah.###.### and, uh, but, uh, now i'm on, the shoe's on the other foot.
68468:14	###.###yes.###.###particularly if they have children.###.###uh-huh.###.### but, uh, and he's, you know, he tries his best,###but the actual quitting he hasn't done --n40815f.###he changed brands to a brand he doesn't like --n4081de.	###he will not smoke in a comfortable position, you know,###but still, he's done everything the smokers anonymous tell you --n4083a9 to do --n4083b8 except quit smoking.###.
68623:60	###well i believe that we've been talking about five minutes.###.###okay,###i think so.###.###and norma, it --n4026e2 is just wonderful to talk to you.###.###good talking to you too,###i've enjoyed it.###.	###.###well, we'll be talking to you later.###.
68634:13	###.###well, we'll be talking to you later.###.###bye, bye.###.###bye, bye.###.###.###well, uh, i don't have strong feelings about changes --n400046 to be made --n400059 in the, uh, jury system, do you.###.	###in fact, i'm graduating from college in about a week###and this past semester i've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials.###.
68678:53	###uh, i mean you,###.###really.###have you served on a jury.###.###never.###.###i never have either,###but my friends, my few friends who --n4013cb have, uh, say just the opposite.###they say they're, uh, remarkably incompetent. and, uh, don't know what they're doing --n401500 and say one thing in the courtroom	###.###huh.###well, you would think that they would get that in the, uh,
68678:106	###uh, i mean you,###.###really.###have you served on a jury.###.###never.###.###i never have either,###but my friends, my few friends who --n4013cb have, uh, say just the opposite.###they say they're, uh, remarkably incompetent. and, uh, don't know what they're doing --n401500 and say one thing in the courtroom	###.###huh.###well, you would think that they would get that in the, uh,

70149:19	###but this is the season for that.###.###oh, gosh.###.### they do, they do pop up occasionally, around here.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###oh. yeah.	###.###yeah.###.
70188:16	###you know, once it rains a little bit, it's, it's filled --n402fc9 up###and everything else just runs off,###.###uh-huh.###.###you know.###.###yeah.###san antonio has that same problem when the rains come --n403188.### it's, it's a complete mess,	###.###yeah.###.
70248:45	### it's just, it's just such a change from, uh, texas because i had grown up with, uh, the heat,###.###uh-huh.###.###and used to essentially,###like you said, you have the cold winter###and then you have the hot summer spring.###.###uh-huh.###.	###it's kind of like, uh, spring, i guess, if you, year round, except,###and then in the winter###and then it seems sort of like a san antonio early winter or fall, year-round.
70312:22	###and here it's, uh, well it's right by the ocean,###.###uh-huh.###.###but, um, it's not the same as corpus.###corpus, you get that humid salty feeling in the air.###.###uh-huh.###.###but here, um, well the water is extremely cold, up here,	###but if you want --n40592e to go --n40593d wind suffering or diving or swimming, you have --n405968 to wear a wet suit. and a thick wet suit at that, because it's just extremely cold###.###uh-huh.
70339:47	###yeah.###probably the pacific breezes make a lot of difference,###.###uh-huh.###it does###and the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region.###but you, um,###but we like it###so it's a nice change.###so we'll be here a couple of years	###.###that's nice.###.
70920:10	###yeah###.###we spent too much money, until our children went to college,###.###yeah.###.### so. so, tell me about,###.###yeah.###.	###.###well, we've been married for five and a half years###and we started out without kids, of course, and found it --n401cf7 much easier to save and used --n401d1a to do a lot, more fun kinds of of things and, uh, did really, um, you know, have a real strict budg-, but, budget
70953:64	###uh-huh.###.###bang,###bang.###.### that's, that's, that threw our budget really out of whack too.###an we, um, have been just forced --n402c48 to budget much more because i quit --n402c6b working --n402c76 to be home with the kids.###and, um, we just really have, uh,###i don't know,### we, we've tried different times,	###.###uh-huh.###.
70957:45	###.### that's, that's, that threw our budget really out of whack too.###an we, um, have been just forced --n402c48 to budget much more because i quit --n402c6b working --n402c76 to be home with the kids.###and, um, we just really have, uh,###i don't know,### we, we've tried different times,###we've done like a survey of like taking, you know, the past three months of where all the money went --n402f3d.###.###uh-huh.###.	###but it seems like there's, um, times when we just have --n40314f to get out --n403162 where we'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we'll go and we'll blow, you know, fifty, sixty dollars in one night going out --n4031e5 to eat, going to a show or doing something --n403214, you know.###.###well, i think that's important for your budget to be realis-,
71024:40	###exactly,###although so much per month anyway.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###and, uh, that really should be in your bu-,###but if you don't spend it, it should be in your bank account at the end of the month.###.###yeah	### let's see,###now, i forget which way we do it --n4051fa.###we don't list all the deductions
71027:15	###yeah,###yeah.###.###and, uh, that really should be in your bu-,###but if you don't spend it, it should be in your bank account at the end of the month.###.###yeah###our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions, um, you know, is to,### let's see,###now, i forget which way we do it --n4051fa.	###and then we get more money back, you know, at the end of the year,###.###oh, no,
71219:12	###basically, what it does --n404896, is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts, that --n4048d9 are, that --n4048f0 are, you know come from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state, that --n404947 are not so affluent.###.###uh-huh.###.###.### they, they don't have a broad based income tax that --n404baa funds the educational system,###.###uh,###well,###.	###.###okay,### to g-, to give you some perspective, this, this town that i had lived in --n404da9 for sometime in nineteen eighty-three was funded --n404dcc sixty-five per cent by state funds.
71230:16	###.###okay,### to g-, to give you some perspective, this, this town that i had lived in --n404da9 for sometime in nineteen eighty-three was funded --n404dcc sixty-five per cent by state funds.###.###yeah.###.###then we had a number of education reforms, that the legislature said, hey, we got --n404fbc to do this --n404fcf,###we got --n4050bd to do this,###we got --n405124 to do this,###but, they forgot --n405196 to put in the state budget the money --n4051c1 to pay for it,	###so,###.### sounds like the way the federal and state system works now --n405365.
71248:9	###.###so, so what --n40543b ended up --n40544a happening was, was a, was a shift.###we went to sixty-five per cent state funding to sixty-five per cent local funding in a matter of four years.###and, uh, i mean,###.###uh, do you mean a, a complete reversal.###because, i guess, they can't raise that money in those, those poorer districts,###huh.###.###oh, complete, complete.	###and now, even the money that --n405926's been raised --n405939 for the local districts is being, is going --n405964 to be siphoned --n405977 off and sent --n40598a to other parts of the state.###.###.
71492:29	### just moved to, to north carolina,###.###oh.###.###and, uh, we were orig-, originally, of course, from this area, from virginia,###but, uh, in north, uh,###in oklahoma, it's the men's garden clubs that i would have wanted --n4020eb to join --n4020fa.###.###my word.###.	###.###for heaven's sake.###.
71904:16	###but i feel guilty for --n40207f not going, because i really i'm, i'm so used to --n4020ca going for, you know, three or four years now.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###i, stayed in pretty good shape during school.###.###but, um,###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
71908:76	###.###yeah,###i, stayed in pretty good shape during school.###.###but, um,###.###i played baseball, all the way through###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###oh, yeah.###.
71936:30	###.###.###no,###some, um,###i walk a lot because, uh, you know, --n4029c2 being in, in school we,###.###yeah.###.###i don't know if your campus was anything like ours,###but our parking lot's in one end of the, of the campus	###so.###you ut-,###.
71964:23	###.###but i usually get in at least a couple of miles at work --n4030b0 just walking around the plant.###.###uh-huh.###.###so,###.###yeah,###it's, uh,### i live, i live on the second story apartments	###so.###.###.
72048:18	###but still, i mean, it was pretty high impact stuff,.###.###those aerobic classes are, are tough the, the high impact.###.###uh-huh.###.### definitely are, are tough classes.###.###yeah,###and she'd, uh, you know,	###so she'd kind of lay it on occasionally, you know,.###.###uh-huh.
72135:42	###.###.###yeah,### the, uh, the, some of the nautilus equipment that i started --n4067ed seeing --n4067f8 at the one that we used --n406817 to go to --n40682a was really interesting,###i mean, they, they, they really know how --n4069e7 to isolate each of the different muscle groups, with those things --n406a1e###.###uh-huh.###.###but, man, they are, it, ut-,###i don't know	###.###uh-huh.###.
72221:37	###.###yeah,###.### makes you feel a lot better.###.###oh, no,###yeah,### there, there's no, no question the, the end result is great###and i, i mean, i enjoyed, you know,###we,	###.###uh-huh,###and i mean you feel so much better, about yourself.
72268:28	###.###i guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force.###.###yeah.###.###few are, uh, basically staying home and being homemakers, and raising kids exclusively.###.###uh-huh.###yeah,### i, i, i grew up in, uh, sixties and early seventies	###she didn't start --n4004f8 working until i was, um, well into high school.###.###uh-huh.
72300:9	###uh-huh.###.###uh, i'm not sure what the future holds --n400bf9 for that###whether,###.### it seems like there's, it seems that there's a grass roots, um, effort or whatever going on### i, i, um, clean houses part-time,###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###huh.###.
72352:36	###.###true.###.###um, and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever.###.###yeah.###i'm surprised that the main people you work for --n402694 are women that --n4026a7 do stay home.###i would think it would be women that --n4027ba were working full-time.###.###yeah,	###.###huh.###.
72418:51	###so, kids are raised --n404219 around their friends and by the media.###.###yeah,###that's true.###.###and that's, you know, that's contributed --n404328,###.###and i think, i think you're going --n4043ee to see a lot more of that in the future.###.###yeah,	###so. if there was some way for, for women to, to stay home even if they could work --n404691, you know,###there are a lot of jobs that --n4047f6 are coming about, like in computers at home, and those types of things, that --n404841 would at least in some ways, um, bridge the gap.###.
72452:41	###you know, in the, in the back,###i grew up about the same time you did --n4053d1,###.###uh-huh.###.###and back in those times we pretty much were taught --n405490 how to be responsible --n4054ab.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, nowadays it's not the case,	###and one of the reasons, i guess --n4056d2, is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working.###they get bombarded --n405816 with junk###and they don't have --n40587b to do anything around the house.
72524:16	###bye-bye.###.###.###okay.###.###sure,### go ahead.###.###what kind of books do you like --n40009c to read --n4000ab.###.	###.###yeah.###.
72570:155	###.###uh-huh.###.###for some reason it seems --n400ca8 to interest me, like people that --n400ccb make a big comeback or, you know, orel hershiser, things like that.###.###sure.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###um, i like --n401143 to re-,###the magazines i###to rel-,
72795:31	###.###and i find that fascinating that people, you know, can do that kind of thing. just make up their minds that that's it. you know, have this one direction.###.###and then do it.###.### do it.###i can't,###i'm not that focused on something.###.###.	###.###.###um, and i'm not, uh, uh, a planner which i wish i was --n405d00.
72807:20	###.###um, and i'm not, uh, uh, a planner which i wish i was --n405d00.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, kind of off the wall.###if someone says, do you want --n405e67 to do this tonight, uh, and i got a mountain of things to do --n405eb6, it's okay, you know,###we do it.###.###uh-huh,	###.###i know,###i know,
72844:17	###that's true,###that's true.###how many people do you supervise --n40690b.###.###uh, about twenty.###.###oh, that's not bad.###.###no.###.	###.###no.###.
72927:17	###.###but, uh,###.###i know the whole situation is bad up here,###we're having a terrible time with the recession.###.###really.###.###yeah,###yeah.	###.###huh.###.
72976:9	###do you know how to use them in your life or to influence --n408385,###.###uh-huh.###.### i, i feel like it's important for young children to read too.###and what you read --n40853b to them.###.###yeah.###.###when my children wer-, were younger --n4085d8, of course,	###and i have grandchildren now,###they were, uh,###i, i read to them a lot.
72983:27	###yeah.###.###when my children wer-, were younger --n4085d8, of course,###they were all married --n40868a and grown --n408699###and i have grandchildren now,###they were, uh,###i, i read to them a lot.###.###that's good.###.	###.###that's re-,###yeah.
72988:24	###they were, uh,###i, i read to them a lot.###.###that's good.###.###and, uh, i think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also.###.###that's re-,###yeah.###.	###but they do read. uh, where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all --n408a4a,###and i think it's important,###.
72989:61	###i, i read to them a lot.###.###that's good.###.###and, uh, i think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also.###.###that's re-,###yeah.###.###i'm not saying they read all the right things	###and i think it's important,###.###oh, yeah.
73003:13	###.###because, uh, even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens --n408c0e, i mean, they don't learn anything.###it's because they can't read.###.###yeah,###it --n408de9's really surprising how many people --n408e08 --n408e0f graduate from high school, and that i work with --n408e3e###.###yeah.###.###and people, i mean,	###and things are misspelled --n40902a###and, it's really, it's pretty sad.###.
73058:31	###oh, tell me about it.###.###especially, you know, if you catch yourself --n40072d short on cash or if you're on vacation, it --n400760's just easier to put everything on a card.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, i find if you're not careful you wind up, uh, a month or so, --n400964 staring those bills in the face	###and it adds up.###.###yeah,
73100:25	###.###yeah.###.### how, how do you look at counting credit cards --n40143b.###.###we just, uh, quit --n4014f4 using them.###.###well, that's,###.###and they got us in trouble,	### we keep them, uh, we keep, uh, one gas card and, uh, and, uh, visa just, you know, in case there's an emergency or, something###.###right.
73221:17	###.###so, yo-, uh, you want --n40318a to make sure that, uh,###is that okay, is that o-, okay, that those people see what it is that you are buying --n4032b0,###.###yeah.###.###and most of the time it is.###.###.###but, most of the others i've sent back	###i've got three card offers --n403598 now, uh, from gas companies and, uh, visa gold and, uh, some,, other bank, uh,###.###uh-huh.
73238:40	###.###oh, i do too,###i don't even open them much,###i throw them out.###.###i don't want --n40397f to have --n40398e to mess with it.###you know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards,###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###a girlfriend of mine found a,###it was a visa or mastercard,
73520:13	###huh-uh.###.###but, we also learned something from that experience as our children got older.###.###yeah.###.###it's that care givers are not omniscient###.###huh-uh.###.	###.###right.###.
73520:22	###huh-uh.###.###but, we also learned something from that experience as our children got older.###.###yeah.###.###it's that care givers are not omniscient###.###huh-uh.###.	###.###right.###.
73520:29	###huh-uh.###.###but, we also learned something from that experience as our children got older.###.###yeah.###.###it's that care givers are not omniscient###.###huh-uh.###.	###.###right.###.
73715:15	###if you could just, um, have a whole bunch.###.### have enough.###.###.###by the time the youngest ones are there --n4077e2, you'll have older one --n407805 to take care of them.###.###that's true.###.###i don't know.	###and, gosh,###i just,###i was seeing something on the television --n407aaa earlier about a little girl that --n407ac9's been telling her mother these terrible stories
73994:61	###you must know him.###his reputation precedes him.###.###yeah,###well, seventh floor.###.###yeah,###.###t a d,###.	### they, they say it's what --n4040ec makes him happy is to give us d a d --ers grief,###so i can believe it###but,
74021:12	###i don't know,###i guess if this is the only place you've lived --n404657, lubbock is a lot different than dallas.###.###yeah,###flat, dry and dirty,###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,	###i mean, here in dallas everything is just real rush, rush.###.###yeah,
74082:3	###.###.###so.###.###yeah,###well my kids are probably needing me to go###so###.###okay,###.	###well, it --n4058db's nice talking to you.###.###yeah,
74156:52	### it wasn't, it --n401046 didn't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me###they were,###.###and you, you didn't, you didn't have --n4011d5 to lock your door.###.###no,###no.###.###and, uh, a lo-,###some of these are urban worries	### let's see,###it was after,###.
74160:14	###.###no,###no.###.###and, uh, a lo-,###some of these are urban worries###but, uh, it's, uh, it's a lot different all though i guess twenty years a go now, in this area, things were, um, similar because twenty years ago### let's see,###it was after,###.	###.###yeah,###to twenty, twenty-five years ago is when we had the washington riots --n4016fa,
74365:49	###but,###.###it was a little easier though wasn't it.###.###uh, yeah,###just the volume makes a big difference,###.###yes.###.### i think as, uh, as, uh, mother you know, i use --n4054f7 to think sometimes it's not so much, uh, it's not so much the kids,	###.###yeah.###and all the things demanded of the mother too
74365:60	###but,###.###it was a little easier though wasn't it.###.###uh, yeah,###just the volume makes a big difference,###.###yes.###.### i think as, uh, as, uh, mother you know, i use --n4054f7 to think sometimes it's not so much, uh, it's not so much the kids,	###.###yeah.###and all the things demanded of the mother too
74368:7	###.###uh, yeah,###just the volume makes a big difference,###.###yes.###.### i think as, uh, as, uh, mother you know, i use --n4054f7 to think sometimes it's not so much, uh, it's not so much the kids,###it's just the volume of it, to try --n405716 to keep all wash done and all the things done and, you know, and everything.###.###yeah.	###i mean,###.###.
74553:87	###.###do youself have children wi-, who --n400aaf are --n400aba or have been --n400acd through the public school system.###.###yes,###i do.###and i was not very happy with the results.###.###i see.###so if you were --n400caf to improve it, what would you do --n400cd6 --n400cdd to improve it.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
74583:21	###uh-huh.###.### pay attention to what --n401738's happening. talk to the teachers. uh, talk to their kids about school. and support the institution###and, a-,###instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the, uh, the teacher's in the middle.###.###uh-huh.###that's, uh, some pretty good ideas.###why don't you do something with those --n401a6e.###.	###.###uh-huh.###well, you should, uh, run for a school board position.
74670:75	###.###uh, just something --n4040dc to, i-,###rather than throw someone in, into that environment, uh, you know, it###.###yeah.### i don't think student, i don't think student teaching is enough.###.###i thought that maybe something.###.###i think that,	###.###uh-huh.###.
74688:29	###.###uh-huh.###.###so there really was no time to try, much of anything and get significant feedback that --n40496b would help the, the student teacher improve very much --n40499a.###.###.###sure.###sure.###.###there are lots of things that --n404b38 could be done --n404b4b in that line, including things like video taping.	###.###.###uh-huh.
74730:7	###.###or.###.###well, that's the two states that --n405e77 adopt on a state wide basis.###.###i see.###.###uh, and so it, uh,###i used --n405fb3 to work for a textbook publisher###and it --n406031 was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted --n406064 by texas, then you had a built-in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject	###.###uh-huh.###.
74747:25	###and, you know, a third of the texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks.###.###sure.###sure.###.###and then the states that --n406515 either don't adopt on a state wide basis or don't have as many kids, just have --n406568 to follow along and take what texas gets --n40658f.###.###right.###.###mumblex california is the biggest for elementary schools	###.###i see.###well, definitely is a national problem if, that they need --n406861 to address --n406870.
74912:65	###uh-huh.###.###we want --n401d13 to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter###and, uh, we need the one extra room.### like, like you said, our rooms are too s-, the bedrooms are too small,###the living room and kitchen are huge,###.###right.###.###but the bedrooms are too small.	###.###right,###there's they, uh,
74977:22	###uh-huh.###.###and he did it hisself,###so most of that, by now, is falling apart.###.###oh.###.###you know, well i mean, it's not just horrible,###but like this tile's come loose off the wall,###the whole bathroom is covered --n4032d8 from ceiling to foot in tile	###.###um, that is awful.###.
75070:9	###and we hooked it back up###and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again.###.###um.###.###but on the east side of the house it runs fine.###.###oh boy, you do have a strange wiring problem there.###.###he put new wiring in,	###.###uh-huh.###.
75140:34	###i don't know what it is --n405f8b off hand.###.###well, he's got seven layers of shingles up there,###and he told us it was a completely new roof.###like i said, he didn't know what he was doing --n406169.###.###yeah,###he must not of.### we stripped ours, we stripped ours off.###we didn't put it over,'cause we put composition roof on.	###.###uh-huh.###.
75169:12	###we have plastic, you know, just tied down on everything, you know, as best we could, real thick edge stuff, i mean,###.###uh-huh.###.###and the wind came in from the north###and it just blew everything off in the middle of the night###and we were asleep### and, and i woke up###and i got up###and it was about four o'clock in the morning	###.###oh, no.###.
75191:8	###uh-huh.###.###and i would go in,###and i'd turn on a light in the room, you know###and the light would come on###and the whole thing would be full of water.###and i mean the light would still come on.###it didn't blow up or anything.###.### my neighbor, or a friend of mine when i lived in louisiana --n407488, her,	###my husband was in the army.###.###uh-huh.
75200:10	### my neighbor, or a friend of mine when i lived in louisiana --n407488, her,###we all lived on base,###my husband was in the army.###.###uh-huh.###.###she woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning, water dripping from hers.###the neighbor's la-, uh, washing machine had uh, over done something,###i don't know###but it was leaking, just pouring water in	###and it was coming out of the lights, fixtures.###.###oh.
75276:22	###.###are you finished with it now.###.###uh, the roof.###.###uh-huh.###.###oh yeah,###yeah,### it's, it's been done for quite some time.	###.###uh-huh,###how long have you lived there --n408d18.
75290:8	###.###uh, see, it's three,###it's just been a-, at three years.###we've been in the house just the three years.###we've been doing a lot of remodeling.###i mean, it's, it had detached, it had a dir-, detached garage###and my husband's built a walkway across###and we're going --n409130 to brick up the garage --n40914b to match the house and things like that###so we,###.	###.###what, uh, the walk.###.
75331:56	###.###so i would say that's one of the largest changes in, at least in my life.###.###yeah,### i, i've seen that just in the last, uh, even five years --n400788 how much they've in-, uh, increased in use --n4007bb. or probably eight years,###when i was a freshman in college --n400949 uh, my degree was in computer, uh, technology originally###.###uh-huh.###.###and it seemed like it would,	###.###uh-huh.###.
75433:45	###.###and now people have jam box with c d players in them, you know. and, hand held t v --s and car phones.###.###yes.###that's certainly, a difference.###.###.###yeah,###that's another one,###yeah,	###uh, ten years ago i was working in a job at a medical center###.###yeah.
75440:7	###yeah,###that's another one,###yeah,###car phones --n402ac0 is a good point, and, uh, cellular phones of all types and beepers.###uh, ten years ago i was working in a job at a medical center###.###yeah.###.###and i had --n402c7e to carry a beeper around###and they were kind of bulky	###and then you had --n402e27 to go --n402e36 find a telephone and call in --n402e55 to find out what they wanted you for --n402e7c and who you were supposed --n402e97 to call --n402ea6.###.###uh-huh.
75600:22	###it's pretty wild.###.###yeah.###even, you know,###that reminds me,###federal express was around ten years ago,###but it was used --n406357 as kind of an extreme emergency###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah.### sure do.
75642:51	###uh, probably the biggest thing we've got --n4001d5 going now is the robberies###and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have --n4002c0.###.###uh-huh.###.###how about you.###.###uh, well, i don't actually live in the city,###but i'd probably say that's roughly right.###i mean crimes against property seem --n4004ea to outnumber crimes against life,	###.###uh-huh.### prob-, probably right, if you look at it from that stand point.
75831:44	###right.###.###uh, i know in my case, i, my wife and daughter were kidnapped --n40474a, during a house robbery back in eighty-five###.###oh, wow.###.###.###oh, my goodness.###.###and we caught, the individuals got caught --n4048e1,	###.###uh-huh.###.

75945:75	###they've actually waited for them, where they've robbed, you know, particular neighborhood --n406954,###they'll rob one house,###then other people will wait up, you know, and wait for somebody to do something else, try --n406aae to take it in their own hands.###.###right.###.###course it doesn't always work out in their favor.###.###right.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.

76751:22	###and i was having my hair cut###.###uh-huh.###.###and the barber got a call --n4065a0 while i was there, uh, from his son's school.###his son's in high school.###and his son was failing gym and, uh, and having trouble, with a few other things.###.###.###but, you know, it's like, uh, this guy was like, why now, there's no problem with my kid.	###the kid had missed all these classes,###and basically he, his answer was, oh, i gave him permission to, to miss.###.

76810:33	###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###i've had interesting conversations on several subjects not, uh, not just this but different, the different things.###.###uh-huh.###.###it --n407a14's amazing how the, you know, people you talk to --n407a4f have some interesting conversations --n407a66	###.###well, we are, though.###.
76810:103	###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###i've had interesting conversations on several subjects not, uh, not just this but different, the different things.###.###uh-huh.###.###it --n407a14's amazing how the, you know, people you talk to --n407a4f have some interesting conversations --n407a66	###.###well, we are, though.###.

77038:30	###.###yeah.###.###so.###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, some of,###yeah,### i, i've only talked to one or two	###but, she hasn't talked to anybody, in dallas, yet.###.###yeah.
77233:30	###it really does.###my wife and i spent a couple years, uh, --n405958 doing church work up in the state of washington right, on the coast.###.###yes.###.###and it rains, you know, a lot there.###.###sure.###.###but, you get used to it.	###and it doesn't really,###it gets to where it doesn't bother, you --n405c93.###.
77263:27	###.###.###right.###.###.###yeah.###that's the way it is, was, --n405faf there, too.###.###yeah.###i think, however, that's like february.	###and some people said to me," well, that's our wintertime."###.###oh, uh-huh.
77316:87	###.###.###okay,###what do you think --n400040 are some current trends in, uh, the way families spend time together --n400083, based on what you've seen --n4000a6.###.###um, i, i think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together --n40021c.###.###yeah.###.###um, i think, uh,	###and i've been off doing my thing all day###and i haven't seen him since eight o'clock this morning.###.
77317:26	###.###okay,###what do you think --n400040 are some current trends in, uh, the way families spend time together --n400083, based on what you've seen --n4000a6.###.###um, i, i think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together --n40021c.###.###yeah.###.###um, i think, uh,###like in my situation, today, on a weekend when couples are supposed --n4003a6 to spend time together --n4003bd, my husband's been off doing his thing all day today,	###and i haven't seen him since eight o'clock this morning.###.###really.
77342:24	###so. yeah,### i can, i can, i know what you mean --n400833.###.### it's, it --n40091f's really hard, hard to find time --n400952 to spend --n400961 together when you both work full time and, uh, you both have hobbies that --n4009a8 are different --n4009b7.###.###yeah.###.###you know, if you have hobbies that --n400bd6 are the same, then, you know, you can enjoy your hobby together,###but my husband and i have different hobbies.###.	###.###no,###no,
77365:23	###.###yeah.###.###and, um, did some shopping and stuff.###.###um, from the people i've talked to --n401271, i don't know if i should bring this into it, but, um, a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that --n4012f0 are more, um, where they could manage their own schedule and, uh, they could spend more time with their kids --n401357###.###uh-huh.###.###because they look back	###i think.###.###yeah,
77399:88	### and, and maybe after we decide --n401eba to have kids i, i might find a job that --n401eed has flexible hours.### i woul-, i hope so anyway.###um, but i would, i don't know.###.###at t i, is that where you work --n402175.###.###uh-huh.###.###it's really kind of sad,###some of the people that i work with --n402278 they, like when i worked on second shift --n4022ab, um, their paren-, their kids go to school during the day	###.###uh-huh.###.
77428:25	###uh-huh, huh.###.###.###yeah.###.### the, the mom stayed home, you know, and raised the kids.###my mom didn't go back to work until i was in junior high school.###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah.###.
77543:66	###i know.###.###.###yeah,###and what --n405de1 --n405de8's sad about that is day cares end up --n405e17 instilling values --n405e26 in your kids. that --n405e41 may not necessarily be consistent with yours.###.###yeah.###.###.###exactly.	###.###yeah.###.
77562:57	###yeah,### i, i see, it seems like that's, that's a big trend, you know, in the last ten years.###day cares have, have, have popped up and become a lot more, um, a lot bigger part of, of the kids' lives.###.###yeah.###.###it's like a home away from home for a lot of them.###.###sure,###is, um,, well,.	###we seem --n406a54 to agree.###.###yeah,
77681:64	###well, we didn't have any, uh, avid, uh, activities like that,###.###.### they, they were interested in a lot of things,###but nothing to quite that depth, i guess --n401c27.###but, we would,###.###mumblex i don't think we've, we've missed a fish store on the entire east, northeast coast of the united states.###.###oh my goodness.	###uh,###.###uh-huh.
77782:40	###yes.###.###and, uh, uh, granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it, but it,### when they, when it's not there --n403e73 they miss it.###.###i think that's true,###but i d-, i also think that's, at least in my experience, truer of girls than boys.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and certainly not to the extent i did with my mother --n40420d.###.###yeah,
77887:177	###.###and there are only two of them###and they didn't live in the same town.###.###that###the trend of, of families and time, where, where parents are spending less time --n405dbf,###you don't have the families, --n405ec5 too, to take up the gap.###.###that's right.###.	###.###yeah.###.
78053:87	###yeah.###.###we usually watch the local news and the, the, uh, national news both.###.###uh-huh,###yeah,###i'm pretty much the same.### i, uh, i find that, uh,###i'm a graduate student###and i, i read a lot for school	###and i really enjoy --n4006ed just sitting down and watching a news broadcast.###.###well you can always get up and leave that.
78091:47	###yeah,###the same thing.###is there any, uh,###what did you think --n40101c about the coverage like over in the, uh, persian gulf.###.###i think they did a great job.###.###yeah,###i thought so too,### it was, it, you know,	###some of the stations i guess --n40135a carried it for twenty-four hours for a couple of days there###and then, you know, the special reports and the extended news coverage i thought --n40148e was really good.###.
78100:37	### it was, it, you know,###for a while when we were really interested --n401276, uh, we saw it all the time.###some of the stations i guess --n40135a carried it for twenty-four hours for a couple of days there###and then, you know, the special reports and the extended news coverage i thought --n40148e was really good.###.###uh-huh.###.###yeah.###.###and you could always find some channel that --n4015a1 had something on	###.###yeah,###right,
78116:12	###that's right,###yeah.###.###yeah,###i noticed that one thing that, that t i did --n4017f6,###you know, they had, uh, uh, they used --n4018d4 to have, well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings,###.###uh-huh.###.###and they used --n401a83 to have a program called t news, and just updates of, of different things that --n401ad2 were going on within t i.	###.###oh, yeah.###.
78120:64	###i noticed that one thing that, that t i did --n4017f6,###you know, they had, uh, uh, they used --n4018d4 to have, well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings,###.###uh-huh.###.###and they used --n401a83 to have a program called t news, and just updates of, of different things that --n401ad2 were going on within t i.###well when all the, the mess with, uh, uh, in the persian gulf came about --n401c7c they started --n401c8b carrying c n n.###.###oh, yeah.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
78277:105	###most people have relocated to the washington area, you know.###.###oh no,### i'd, i'd rather have baltimore with the home town atmosphere.###.###yeah,###that's,### i, i like it, i like it a little bit better, too.###it --n40545c's interesting though, um, to meet different populations.### i, i'm just now --n405531 being, uh, from pittsburgh originally, i'm just now meeting different populations like chinese students and things	###you know, that, that's an interesting, uh, interesting perspective.###but i, i really much, much like the hometown area,###yeah.
78375:19	###they didn't call you for mother's day.###.###we were gone.###.###you weren't home.###.###uh, d-,###no,###we weren't home###but she had, she had le-, called and left a message on our recorder	###.###yeah,###oh, that's good.
78390:52	###so.###.###well i guess we should stop now.###.###well i thank you for --n407fc9 calling,###i have enjoyed it.###.###uh-huh,###oh good.###.	###yeah.###.###uh, uh, so do i,
78426:26	###in germany.###.###uh, and,###.###well,###.### we, we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance.###.###now there's a place i'd like --n4004b5 to visit --n4004c4.###.	###unfortunately, a, a little bit too young to really appreciate.###.###oh, that's neat.
78581:15	###our next vacation will, will be scuba diving,###i'm sure.###.###you have any children.###.###no,###not yet.###.###okay,###then that's probably one of the reasons our,	###.###yeah.###.
78639:10	###.### that, that sounds like a lot of fun.###.###ye-,###.###our family had a reunion --n404b0d last year that --n404b20 was kind of like that, too,###.###yeah.###.###that there were several hundred, uh, people	### i, i didn't go,###.###um.
78662:30	###i hate them because they're hard to jockey around --n4052d8, you know,###but maybe a pickup with the back on,###.### some-, or something like, uh, what's the, like the volkswagen vanagon.###i've heard is really nice.###.###yeah.###.###.###so you could kind of sleep in it sometimes,	###.###yeah.###.
78810:31	###okay,###do you vote regular..###.###yeah,###i do,###i try and vote in every single election.###.###every one.###.###but, uh, that's just since, in the past say about six years.	###.###well see, that's me.###i've never paid any attention to voting.
78890:20	###they want less government involvement, in society###.###uh-huh.###.###and so they're more, less apt --n401904 to vote in, you know, more aid to people,###or more, uh, they're less apt --n401a37 to vote in programs that --n401a52 involve the government running things.###.###huh, okay.###.###so,	###.###no,###i never have.
78985:16	###you know, i didn't know anything about bush or dukakis.###.###so what do you think --n402eae about, uh, what do you think --n402ed5 about what you see --n402eec on t v about them, like in the news or on the ads,###do you kind of just,###.###okay,###i don't remember anything about dukakis,###.###you don't.###.	###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.
79041:8	###so that's kind of, how i judge --n404122.###there's a few things where they have --n4041b0 to say yes or no --n4041cb, like abortion or gun control,###or let me see,###i try --n40430a to look at what, if some of the newspaper articles, or the,###i don't trust t v as much,###but newspaper articles can show wha-, how they voted --n4044a5 in the past### and, but you get, you know,###.###right.###.	###.###right,###and like i said most of the poli-, the politicians, i'm mumblex,
79216:9	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, what is, what effect --n407147 does that have --n40715a on him running for president.###do you know what i mean --n40726f.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.	###see we really don't see the, the true person anyway.###.###that's right.
79233:59	###.###right.###.###but see they're trying --n407962 to find an excuse --n407979 not to deal with what, you know, the issues that people really want --n4079bc to know about --n4079cf, because on those issues you have --n4079f6 to say yes or no.###and if they don't say yes or no, then maybe somebody --n407c0e will vote for them that --n407c29 wouldn't have if they had come down on the wrong side.###do you know what i'm saying --n407daa.###.###right.###.###so they just try and make it a personal thing,	###and even from reagan, it was all just like, looks like a mcdonald's commercial, you know.###.###uh-huh.
79243:29	###i mean, if you remember any of the t v commercials from the last presidential campaign, they all had, uh, pictures of bush with his grandchildren, walking around with his grandchildren###and even from reagan, it was all just like, looks like a mcdonald's commercial, you know.###.###uh-huh.###.###that's about what it looked like --n4081e8.###.###well what did you think --n40826a of reagan as a president.###.###i just thought he was really inept.	### he, they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet###and the people that --n4084d9 were,###.
79257:3	###do you think he won from carter because of the, um, the hostages that --n40857b were held --n40858a at that time.###.###well i think that was part of it,###i think there's a lot of thin-,###the economic problems that the country was having --n4087f2 at the time and the, the recession and stuff,###.###uh-huh.###.###people just had a picture of carter as --n408925 not being real capable,###but he, actually,	###this###i thought he was great.###.
79359:8	###.### we, we have out here###uh, up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way,###.###uh-huh.###.###they had some bends --n400e37, around that we could find and put them in --n400e66###.###uh-huh.###.	###it wasn't very well advertised###.###uh-huh.
79384:48	###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean there just,###it's such a###i waste,###i just hate --n4015e6 to think about it.###.###yeah,###now an additional thing is, uh,	###.###uh-huh.###.
79450:78	###and there's,###.###right.###.###i've seen a few things but not very much, really###.###uh-huh.###.###and i, i think that's a shame###they need --n402800 to, uh, do a little more,	###or, is there some reason not to --n402ab8,###.###exactly.
79450:114	###and there's,###.###right.###.###i've seen a few things but not very much, really###.###uh-huh.###.###and i, i think that's a shame###they need --n402800 to, uh, do a little more,	###or, is there some reason not to --n402ab8,###.###exactly.
79481:7	###uh-huh,###yeah,###i agree with you there,###another thing that i like --n403034 here which --n403043 is,###i do with,###i have --n403117 to actually go to two different recycling areas because one of them is that, uh,###their aluminum cans is for, uh, children's hospital, for a burn fund###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah.###.
79563:22	###yeah.###.###.###yes,### i, i'm glad, --n404a6a to see some of these things, i think --n404a99.###.###.###right.### i think, i think it is getting more, you know, advertisement.###.	###.###right.###.
79570:7	###right.### i think, i think it is getting more, you know, advertisement.###.###people are becoming more conscience --n404c95 all the time that it's necessary to do --n404cc8, and that we need --n404ce3 to somehow get away from the fact that we have --n404d12 to have everything individually wrapped,###.###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###.
79586:3	###i'm that's about my, uh, some on recycling###.###yeah.###.###but i, i enjoyed --n4050e0 talking to you.###.###okay,###well, i did too.###.###uh-huh,	###.###speakera134-1*t134-1.###bye now.

80085:35	###.###yeah.###.###i think a lot of people go in debt because they think, oh, you know, i can just charge it,###but really, i mean, if they don't have the money then, they aren't going --n401206 to have it in a month,###so,###.###yeah,###that's true.###.	###.###there are times, when it's, when it's very useful --n401464, like, uh, emergency trip, or something.###.
80113:68	###but, uh, i, you really do need --n40191b to be very, um, oh, responsible about it###or you end up in deep trouble.###.###yeah.###i made that mistake when i first got a job --n401abb###and that's kind of like,###it --n401b8e took me quite a while to pay them off,###.###uh-huh.###.	###and that worked for a while###and then we got married###so we decided to, you know, if we used them we would pay them off as we go.
80312:8	###.###i'm, uh, twenty-seven.###.###okay,###so you're still young.###.###yeah,###still young,###getting older.###.	###so.###.###speakerb43-1*t43-1.

80379:39	###and then you don't work out because you,###.###you get winded.###.###right,###and so,###.###oh, i smoke a pack a day###an,###.	###.###i can't quit smoking,###i've tried.
80462:35	###well, get your girlfriend to work out with you.###a lot of women like that.###i'd love it if my husband would ask me --n404b59 to work out with him.###he doesn't work out very often.###course, he don't need --n404c97 to.###he's small###and he works as a laborer on the railroad.###.###yeah.###.	###he doesn't have --n404e87 to do anything.###.###right.
80486:22	###.###well you can gain too much weight.###i gained a little bit too much,###but i looked,###with my first little boy, i did gain a lot of weight,### i got, i got about fifty pounds overweight with him###and i didn't loose it until two years ago###and then i got pregnant and, you know, ruined that,###so.###.	###.###yeah,###well, actually, like i say, it ain't as bad this time, because i was in shape when i got pregnant --n405767.
80511:66	###.###about weight.###.###well yeah,###and about, working out and fitness, you know,###.###exercise.###.###i like --n405c89 to, to work out to look good and stay in shape###and, you know, i know it's good for me,	###.###well that's what my friend did --n405ffe.###.
80516:47	###.###exercise.###.###i like --n405c89 to, to work out to look good and stay in shape###and, you know, i know it's good for me,###but people that --n405e4f live for it and, you know, eat a bunch of different pills, and, all that kind of stuff, it gets a little bit obsessive.###.###well that's what my friend did --n405ffe.###.###.	###and really, we was, you know,###even with her taking all those e-, expensive vitamins and stuff, we stayed right on the same track with each other##, you know, developing and everything.
80518:17	###.###i like --n405c89 to, to work out to look good and stay in shape###and, you know, i know it's good for me,###but people that --n405e4f live for it and, you know, eat a bunch of different pills, and, all that kind of stuff, it gets a little bit obsessive.###.###well that's what my friend did --n405ffe.###.###.###well, she was, she was with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and everything else###and really, we was, you know,	##, you know, developing and everything.###.###yeah.
80561:8	###.###yeah,###it's too dangerous.###.###oh, i wouldn't, i could just see hair start --n4068f6 growing out of my upper lip or something.###.###.###yeah,###i had a friend whose brother --n406a34 did steroids###and as soon as he stopped --n406abe working out he just ballooned out.	###and he just, really looked bad.###.###really.
80621:25	###i can get out and do that, as long as it's not hot.###.###uh, i can't.###.###if it's hot, you can't do that.###but in the rain, oh, i love --n407d0e to run in the rain,###just, you know, be careful --n407dec not to slide.###.###yeah.###.	###.###no,###you can't,
80630:34	###.###but you can't ride your bike at all in the rain, can you.###.###no,###you can't,###it's dangerous.###.###you slide.###.###at least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could	###.###uh-huh.###.
80769:24	###.### what, what kind of, what kind of paint do you normally use --n401cb0.###.###well, uh, we used a latex, uh, wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork###and my job was mostly the woodwork.###.###okay,###uh-huh.###.###my husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers	###.###uh-huh.###.
80769:43	###.### what, what kind of, what kind of paint do you normally use --n401cb0.###.###well, uh, we used a latex, uh, wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork###and my job was mostly the woodwork.###.###okay,###uh-huh.###.###my husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers	###.###uh-huh.###.
80841:64	###.###um, that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom.###.###oh it was awful,###it was absolutely hideous### and, and we had a dinner party before we started --n403b8a renovating it###and a, a guest went in there###and he said it --n403cc9's a good thing i went to the bathroom before dinner because if i had had something to drink --n403d28 and went in there i would think i was having hallucinations.###.###really.	###.###uh-huh.###.
80866:78	###.###sure.###.###it wouldn't be any kind of special, um, special effects type thing.###.###yeah.###.###it would be just plain paint.###.###well it's not hard to do --n4049aa if you get everything prepared --n4049c5 ahead of time.	###and it can be done --n404dac a whole lot faster.###and with rollers and, uh, modern latex paints,###.
80918:16	###.###um.###.###and the whole point of using it is to save yourself work.###you can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape.###but use, use good, uh, stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands, that --n406149 will go down and come up easily --n40616c.###.###okay.###.###.	###i think you are, just made my project a lot easier.###.###well i wish you very good luck with it
80938:23	###.###well if i were closer i might.###oh, well i hope your project turns out great###and i, really think that it --n406a3b's exciting that you're going --n406a5a to try the sponge painting.###i think that could give it a really a,###.###well, we'll see how it goes --n406c16,###i may just be flat painting over it.###.###well, of course that's the other advantage of paint.	###.###yeah.###.
81153:107	###i read the wall street journal,###not as in depth as i used --n403870 to, because they, their articles seem --n40389b to be getting even longer and longer###but,###.###yes,###well again, i read that, uh, two columns on the front.###.###yeah.###.###.	###i feel pretty well versed in, in what i'm doing --n403d25 because i, i do spend more time on that than i do, say, on sports, or although i watch that,###.###uh-huh.
81225:19	###.###and i do.###i really think.###.###yeah,###i think i do too.###i think you have to let, yo-, you got --n4052d5 to segregate some of it.###.###yeah.###.	###.###okay,###well nice to talk to you.
81251:16	### we, i think the last one we saw --n400131 was, uh, teenage mutant ninja turtles part two.###.###oh, now, i lo-, i like the turtles.###my little boy's four###and he loves them.###.###well, we don't have any kids###but we like them anyway.###.###oh, that's okay.	###.###um, we're late twenties.###.
81317:38	###did you see pretty woman.###.###no,###but i've been hearing a lot about it.### i don-, we don't get to the video store very often###and we don't have cable.###.###oh, gosh.###.###well we don't really want cable,	###.###yeah.###.
81332:25	###mumblex###i'm from kentucky originally,###.###uh-huh.###.###and we used --n4015d5 to get five channels without cable.###.###yeah.###.###you know, forty,	###but here in texas we only get two channels,###and that's, um,###do you watch soap operas.
81355:13	###well we get the channel with young and the restless on it.###.###okay.###.###and then, uh, i think general hospital###and that comes on different channel.###.###yeah,###it does.###.	###and that's no cartoons for my little boy.###but we've got a v c r and a lot of tapes.###.
81530:42	###yeah.###.###well did that come on t v###or did it come out in the,###.###no,###it came out in the theater.###.###oh.###.	###but i don't, i don't know if it's still playing any where else.###.###well i, i think,
81603:22	### or, or who was it --n405ecd###christopher reeve or mike douglas.###.### might have been michael douglas. oh, that --n405f98 starred in it.###.###yeah.###.###yeah,###it was michael douglas.###.	###.###huh-uh.###.

81921:69	###so you're just as likely --n403adc to fl-, wake up and discover you're in two inches of water.###.###do you have a lot of property, i mean a lot of yard around your house now, in denton.###.###uh, it's a third of an acre.###i don't think that's a lot, uh,###in fact, i have been real disappointed --n403e7e in the six years that i've lived out here --n403ead about lot sizes.###i'm more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being what most people have --n403fea.###.###yeah,	###they're built --n404214 practically on top of each other.###.###that's true.
81946:47	###well, i've got more --n404810 on one side than i've got on the other,###but i'm like you,###i came down from colorado###and there was more land --n4049a1 --n4049a8 up there around a yard with a big full back yard, which###here, i look out my back yard###and i can see the gate.###i mean the fence is right there,###i mean just don't run too fast,###or you'll hit it###and i'm not used to that either.	###but to me, you put the swimming pool in your back yard###and you've lost your back yard.###.
81990:25	###.###it ju-,###well see now, with our jobs mainly hitting downtown dallas we couldn't go too much further,###but, we pra-, we went that way.###it was the schools and the cost of houses,###so we kept --n405efa going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic, time --n405f45 to get into work --n405f5c,###and that's where we stopped --n40608d.###it was the tham-, same problem.###but i think plano's,###.	###.###i got layed --n406277 off by t i.###.
82069:9	###uh-huh.### it, it is scary though, isn't it.###.###oh yeah.###i mean, uh, the last two, uh, years, our winters have been absolutely nothing.###.###right.###.###i mean, maybe, one snow.###.	###north carolina.###that's up there by kentucky, isn't it.###.
82077:18	###i mean, maybe, one snow.###.###well, all right,###north carolina.###that's up there by kentucky, isn't it.###.###kentucky.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###okay.###.
82130:15	###.###oh, twenty, uh, seven.###i almost forgot my age.###.###okay.###well, we're the same age.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah,	###so that's okay.### it's, i think it's just something that --n401d93 goes with the territory.###.
82175:10	###i just laugh### every time they have a, every time they have snow, on the ground --n402a7c everything's closed up.###.###.###and you know, you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road.###.###that's true.###.###but, uh,###.	###.###no,###not really,
82269:3	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###golly, that's, that's bad.###.###but,###yeah,###it's,###yeah,	###uh,###well, that was four years ago, too,###it's probably a lot worse now.
82317:24	###yeah,###in between people.###so that kind of threw them off.###.###um. uh,###.###but they're doing a lot of research here, uh, the e p a.###.###for the air pollution.###.	### they're, they're real big into it.###they've got research triangle park here,###and they're, you know, they're just doing a lot of, uh, lot of stuff.

82662:21	###.###yeah,###i understand that,###yeah.###they really grow up quick. especially at that early age.###.###yeah.###.###but my, my wife was, uh,###she worked part-time when my oldest was, was little --n401872	###but, uh, that worked out really well because it --n4019ab's a big transition i think --n4019ce to have children.###.###oh, yeah.
83324:50	###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###well...###.###but i think it is, er-r-r,###i mean, i think you, you still have a view that the american voter is different from other voters.###.###.	###i think voters are motivated, uh...###.### what about, what about voters in the other countries that you were talking about --n40775e.
83747:15	###so i got him to take the alternator off and take it and, uh, you know, get a replacement part.###.###uh-huh.###.###so we went to a, uh, a, a place called quality auto parts### an, and their parts are supposed --n40058a to be guaranteed --n40059d and, and everything###and they're, they're, uh, very reasonable.###so, uh, i bought the alternator,###we p-, put it on the car###and it, it didn't work,	###.###oh, no.###.
83825:24	###uh, and then, you know just basic maintenance and oil changes### an i, and i do not do my oil changes###and i will not do my oil changes.### i've, i think the first time i tried --n402a4f to do one and ended up, um, --n402a7a trying --n402a85 to ge-, uh,###yo-, borrowed somebody else's jack###and i did this###and i went and bought everything,###.###uh-huh.###.	### an, and, uh, and then to go to the trouble,###that i figured it --n402f0b's easier spending eighteen bucks at jiffy lube.###.
83915:3	### and, and, uh, somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message###and you can leave a message.###.###okay.###.###i know someone that --n404b1d did that,###you leave a message###and they'll, they'll call you back.###.###okay,	###well that's good to know --n404cc8.###i haven't been doing### th-, this is the first time i've been called --n404dba --n404dc1 in a long time
84033:13	###.###ooh.###.###i know,###we are --n40028d about to hit it in ten, few minutes.###i figured i could make this call and get it over with.###we are going --n400414 to mow and trim and edge,###.###yeah.###.	###.###you know what.###it seems like we are doing it here forever.

84050:177	###.###that was all that --n4008a5 was there.###.###uh-huh.###.###and we hired a professional landscaper to do it.###and i have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done --n4009e6 because it has always been incorrectly planted --n400a09###or the plants do not make the winter time.###.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.

84351:29	###did you just move down here.###.###uh, we moved here a year ago.###yeah,###last spring.###we moved in here may, this house, may of last year.###so it --n406858 was really too late to do much.###.###um. who, who, who, who.###because i have got a flower, i have got, i have probably got, do, do, do, do, i do not know how many square feet it is --n406aa8, a big circular driveway.	###and i am into that.###.###oh.
84375:34	### i am wanting bl-, i want blue and purple and, you know, just different shades of that. because my, my house is gray,###.###you want blue.###.###and blue looks so pretty against it.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###ooh, blue is hard, you know.	###.###i bought,###well, i would like --n407552 to have one that --n407569 would bloom next year too. that --n40758c will come back up.
84426:19	###.###uh-huh.###.###blue.###.###salvia.###.###salvia.###.###uh-huh.	### and it will, it, but it insists on full sun.###.###okay,
84596:33	###but i went home,###and we were watching t v,###.###yeah.###.###and this thing --n4020f6 came on where these, a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and, and robbing them --n402179.###.###oh.###.###and it was really disgusting.	###and i mean, you he-,###.###were they teenagers
84632:13	###like i say, s-,###.###i know it.###how s-, deprived could they be --n402add if they had a camcorder.###those are a thousand bucks.###.###yeah.###unless they stole it.###and i mean, that is one big thing down here.###i mean, they have like, uh,	###i mean, they are eighteen to twenty-four, some of the young men and women.###but, i mean, you can, you can see the crime stoppers ads on television.###and they are,
84642:21	###and they are not all young.###i mean, they are eighteen to twenty-four, some of the young men and women.###but, i mean, you can, you can see the crime stoppers ads on television.###and they are,###sometimes it is the same people that --n402fc6 have been, that --n402fdd have been observed --n402ff0###and they still can't catch them.###.###yeah.###.###and you are wondering how, you know. um, we lived in minneapolis and wisconsin --n403183.	### i, i, know, i, i, i know it is getting worse.###i do not know what the world is --n40345e or is not --n403471.###uh, the dimi-,
84666:44	###.###and you are thinking to yourself, um.###.###i wonder where,###.###i know.###.###i do not know.###i wonder where he gets it --n403a4f.###you know, you must,	###.###that###and i do not think a lot of parents,
84675:83	###you know, you must,###i think t v is bad. because they, uh, show all sorts of violence on,###.###that###and i do not think a lot of parents,###i mean, i do not, i do not know how it is --n403cf8 in the air force base.###but, uh, i just do not think a lot of people, because of the economy, both need --n403e47 to work, you know.###i just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more.###.###yeah.	###.###uh,###.
84695:42	###and i was the subordinate.###and, you know. it was sort of like there were boundaries.###.###oh, definitely.###.###and i do not think, i do not know,###i think today a lot of parents, um, are ruled --n404660 by their kids.### i, i,###.###i think so definitely.	###.###yeah.###right.
84734:9	###.###i am in the air force.###yes.###.###okay.###.###and so, uh, people outside the air force doing engineering get paid --n405449 a lot more than we do.###.###sure.###.	###.###huh.###.
84738:16	###okay.###.###and so, uh, people outside the air force doing engineering get paid --n405449 a lot more than we do.###.###sure.###.###and so all the young engineers are like, well, i am just, going, you know,###.###huh.###.	###and that, you know,###.###right.
84783:15	###so,###.###that is the way to do it --n405eb8.###i mean, and that's,###you know, at least the air force is,###i do not know,### i just, uh, i am nervous in dallas.###i mean, i, you know, i mean, i go to like an aerobics class or something.###and, i, you know, uh, seventy women in a jazzercise class in a public, uh, parks and rec building.###and you are supposed --n406384 to feel safe,	### it does not matter race,###but, you know, it is an inter racial mix.###and you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards.
84811:68	###i mean, did you,###i do not know,###i was in the grocery store this morning.###we, uh, went to new orleans for four days and came back late last night, --n406b9a driving.###and it is about seven hours.###.###huh-uh.###.###um, and that is a very,###we had never been there.	###.###uh-huh.###.
84819:17	###um, and that is a very,###we had never been there.###that is a very, very neat town to visit --n406da1. uh, in terms of the french quarter and all of the things you hear about --n406df0.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###but the crime is so bad there.	###how to carry your wallet --n4070f3,###uh.###.
84917:37	###.###well, you, you, hear about people opening the door and getting blown --n40894c away.###.###.###or people, you know,###uh-huh.###.###oh, yeah.###and it does, i mean, it is, it is not a reason.###i mean, i have been to new york.	###.###.###uh-huh.
85035:35	###how can you even think like that --n40b090.###.### i-, i-, it is, yeah, isn't it something.### i mean, i, i have a, i am originally from pittsburgh, pennsylvania,###and i have a niece and nephew.###and i just, uh, i mean###my ten year old nephew says things that he is aware of --n40b45b that i am just going, michael, how did you hear about that --n40b49a --n40b4a1.###.###.###you know, it is just,	###.###yeah.###.
85106:77	###i think that's just part of their overall educational process, is to get out and see and do things.###.###right,###uh-huh.###.###yeah,###yeah.###and so, it's uh,###we have, uh, lived several places around the u s###and we have, where we've lived --n401187, we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area,	###and it's just, uh, it --n40154e's helps, i think, the children to, when they're learning in school --n401599, to say, well, i've been there###and i've seen that.###.
85138:26	###.###and we could, uh, read the things in the history books and understand what they said --n401d63, when it was like, we need food, we need --n401d9a to raise food quickly because this place gets very cold very soon --n401dd1.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###we've, uh, gone through that, uh,###.###.	###and so i made a special effort --n4020f9 with my children to do things like that.###and even now with my grandchildren, i feel it's a very important thing --n40220e to be done --n402221.###.
85217:24	###.###we've lived here about seventeen years,###and it's, uh,###we enjoy --n403cd5 living here.###it's where we originally started out --n403d46,###and we've lived up north for a while in chicago and over in tennessee.###so, wound up back about two hundred miles aware, away from where we started out --n403ec6.###.###yep.###.	###it --n4040ce's been a pleasure talking with you.###.###okay.
85248:46	###.###but the major cause here, and we always seem --n400447 to, and it seems --n400462 to be validated --n400475 by the press, is the car pollution.###we don't have too much industrial pollution.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###uh, car pollution seems --n40064d to be the one and only thing that, that i can really put my finger on --n400698 here.###.###um, that isn't the same in the washington area because we don't have any major, um, industry except for, uh, government and services.	###um, also the worth of the hub of three airports###in this general area there is, uh, national, dulles, and then, uh, baltimore, washington.###and it,
85271:53	###.###well, most people talk about the noise pollution --n400f8a from airplanes rather than the air pollution.###.###but the, uh,###apparently the air pollution and the fact that it's delivered --n4010ac right up in high altitudes is a very significant factor.###.###yeah.###.###.###i would think so.	###i happen to r-, just read something the other day###at least in the boston paper there were three things that, that --n4013f6 come to note.###one, is that the carbon fluorides that --n4014ea are, uh, being released --n401509 into the atmosphere are causing even a larger hole in the southern hemisphere in the ozone layer
85592:52	###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, but there's, you know, there, there are a lot of buildings###but it's just two stories.###uh, on the second floor they have, they don't have a patio###but they have a sunroom instead of the patio.###on the first floor, um, where i am --n401085, there's a patio.###.###oh, okay.	###.###yeah.###.
85713:13	###.###right.###.###.### i haven't, i haven't, i have yet --n403190 to see a basement in a house.###.###huh.###.###and, uh,###.	###is there a lot of sand in,###i always think it's like a desert,###i don't know.
85859:13	###.###yeah.###.###uh, my folks, um, had an apartment for a while when we were kids --n405d63###but, um, for the most part i-, they, they always had, you know,###and pennsylvania always had a single family home###and so, you know, as soon as we could we, we got a single family home,###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
86081:79	###.###and it's always been military###and it's always been,###and that's, that's always been the way of the world. don't you think.###.###which i think that --n40550f that's not the, the way the majority of the people over there really are --n40555a.###.###yeah.###so it's really hard, when you see the leaders, compared to the people --n4056ca.###.	###and there are a lot of people who --n405acc are good people.###.###yeah,
86138:105	### i'm, i'm sort of mixed on this.###i think that the, the answer may lie in, uh, not in so much a, uh, national kind of medical thing that li-, like england has --n400568 but more of a, um, national insurance, uh, sort of clearinghouse or whatever.###i think that, uh, too many, uh,###the problem with, with right now is w-, that we've got too many different health insurances that people have --n40087c to go through --n40088f### and, and i think that, i think you, you mentioned canada.###i think that they have a system where, uh, they, the government deals with the, with,###i mean, you, you go to whoever you want --n400cc6 but file through one, one s-, particular, uh, setup###.###um, i see.###.	###.###yeah.###well, i, i think that --n4010ee, uh, again --n401105 having gone through a period when i was out of work and had --n401140 to buy health insurance on my own --n401163, if you don't have a company supporting you in the, uh, picking up the major portion of your health insurance, the cost is p-, almost prohibitive.
86259:81	###because they don't have --n40496d to worry about --n404980 going in and, and paying, uh, seventy-five dollars --n4049b3 to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes.###.###.###right.###.###that's a,###.###yeah,### i, i, uh, i, i really liked it.### we both, my wife and i both did.	###you just pay the, the five dollars right then###and then you're done with it.###.
86274:32	###but here again the, the doctor's practices in hospitals, have gon-, become fairly sizable businesses under themselves now.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, you take a hospital, uh, the physical plant itself,###you have --n4052cb to pay your share of the operating of that eight story building, uh, when the e-, rooms are empty --n40532a.###.###right.###.	###and, uh, that's how you come up with aspirin that --n405524 costs four dollars apiece and things like that. the horror stories that you hear --n405567 about people going into the hospital for a week and, uh, it being, a four thousand dollar bill --n4055c2.###.###right.
86421:72	###really.###.###well we were there in the winter. in jan-, uh, january or february,###i don't remember which,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###i was born --n401a0e in saudi arabia	###.###uh-huh.###.
86439:13	###so i don't remember that###and, i was three when we moved back here --n401d28.###.### at wha-, at, excuse me, at what age did you,###.###.###oh, that's too bad###because,###.###so i don't remember	###.###uh-huh.###.
86439:26	###so i don't remember that###and, i was three when we moved back here --n401d28.###.### at wha-, at, excuse me, at what age did you,###.###.###oh, that's too bad###because,###.###so i don't remember	###.###uh-huh.###.
86475:36	###.###really.###.###but,###.### we, we found that in jamaica. it was the same way, that people would come up and try and sell you, well try and sell drugs and things like that###.###uh-huh.###.###but they, they were so destitute	### and, and they would come up and ask you, you know, if, if you want --n402d62 to buy different things###and really, after awhile it really gets annoying,###.
86481:73	###.###uh-huh.###.###but they, they were so destitute###and i guess they, they make all their money on tourism### and, and they would come up and ask you, you know, if, if you want --n402d62 to buy different things###and really, after awhile it really gets annoying,###.###yeah.###.	###.### the, the worst place was in marrakech###.
86527:15	###.###well that's great.###where else have you been --n403978.###.###uh,###.###well you lived in france,###.###yes.###.	###.###no###actually i haven't been all through europe,
86530:18	###.###uh,###.###well you lived in france,###.###yes.###.###so you've been all through europe.###.###no	###like i haven't been to italy yet.###.###no.
86622:26	###australia.###yeah.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###uh, but,###.###did you have shrimp.###i've seen in, you know,	###and,###.###i don't remember if i had shrimp.
86661:66	###.###and i was by myself in china too.###.###really.###.###yeah.###.###oh wow.###.###china was a little bit more, uh, of a challenge.	###.###uh-huh.###.
86673:74	###uh-huh.###.###and so i never --n4057a8, you know, got out by myself, or not much,###.###uh-huh.###was it very expensive.###.###no,###actually i paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit,###no	### and, mumblex but this is from hong kong,###.###you're kidding.
86714:9	###i guess i relate it to, to japan where things are very expensive --n406339, aren't they --n406354.###.###oh, japa-,###japan's ridiculous.###.###yeah.###yeah.###.###and i stayed, i didn't stay in the top of the line hotels###but i stayed in,	###.###uh-huh.###.
86863:54	###.###see in california they, in california they make you register when you buy ammunition --n402391.###.###pardon.###.###.###yeah.###uh-huh.###.###you have --n4024c4 to sign a, you know,	###.###yeah.###.
86874:33	###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###.###now rifles aren't too bad,	###.###.###yeah.
86971:66	###not everybody needs a gun###but sooner or later i need one.###you know, whether i'm out --n404336 hunting or you know,###i'm never had --n4043fe to protect my life or,###.###yeah.###.###well i did in the service but not, you know, not on the street###so i don't really need one in the, in the aspects,###.	###.###no,###huh-uh.
87079:17	###.###all right.###i think there is a lot of responsibility --n40653a on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever --n406575 is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one --n4065b4.###.###right.###.###you know, i don't want --n406787 to get out there --n40679e deer hunting and have some guy blow me away,###so.###.###oh, yeah.	###we agreed pretty well on this i think --n4069a2.###.###yeah,
87149:50	###it just makes the whole place seem like that.###.###right.###now just to focus on that a minute, i guess, uh, uh,###when, uh, previous secretary of, uh, educa-, bennett, i think his name was, became the drug czar, uh, for, uh, president bush --n401167, he was going --n40117e to focus on it, on this area and do something about it###.###yeah.###.###and i see that even he was met --n4013ca without, with, with little success, even though the entire, i guess --n401435 a, a quite a bit of money and other, uh, planning efforts went into that.###.	###.###well,###.
87367:38	###and most of the husbands,###this is really peculiar,###most of the husbands cook.###.###great.###.###i mean, the wives during the day, you know, get, i guess, so burned out on --n4003f2 cooking whatever they have --n400409 to cook --n400418 every day.###.###.###um, you know they don't really care about gourmet stuff,	###.###oh, that's nice.###.
87372:14	###.###i mean, the wives during the day, you know, get, i guess, so burned out on --n4003f2 cooking whatever they have --n400409 to cook --n400418 every day.###.###.###um, you know they don't really care about gourmet stuff,###but it was the guys that --n40061b got together and did all this.###.###oh, that's nice.###.###and, um, like my husband just, he really, really likes --n400748 to cook in terms of, um, oh, barbecue,	###i think it's caveman,###.###right,
87384:6	###.###right,###right.###.###i'm telling you,###but, um, he really does cook###and it's a good thing because, you know, you can't, you can't knock that.###.###no.###.	###and so we've gotten together###and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals.###.
87395:48	###and so we've gotten together###and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals.###.###.###and it's really, really kind of a neat thing to do --n400ce7.###you,###.###how often do you meet --n400dbd.###.###well, we try,	###it's like, you know, if we can do it once every six months, we're doing well.###.###oh, yes,
87458:36	###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###well, yeah,###that's true.###and we have a gourmet friend that --n402690 can't stand fish###so i mean he can get within,###.###oh, yeah,	###.###oh, my.###.
87482:37	###um,###.###it makes you, uh, keep --n402b4b looking for recipes every time you have an eye out, for something like,###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###right.###.###right.	###but otherwise, um, i guess, you know, entertaining, um,### i, i guess i have recipes###i, um,
87499:24	###.###so, you know, they would be pretty elaborate.###.###yeah.###.###um, but it's fun.###i mean it --n40314f took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff,###.###oh, wow.###.	###.###yeah.###.
87569:9	###.###.###right.###there you go --n4040d1.###.###uh, so, oh, i'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on.###but i can't do it, you know, working full-time###and, it's just too much.###.###i know.	###.###those people that --n40442a try --n404435 to do everything.###.
87576:8	###and, it's just too much.###.###i know.###we're all not built --n404314 like, uh, what, what, oh, martha stewart, you know.###.###those people that --n40442a try --n404435 to do everything.###.###.###yeah.###.	###.###ugh.###.
87593:10	###yeah.### shot a video of the whole thing,###i don't know.###.###yeah,###right.###.###but it's, it's really kind of a neat thing.###i get a kick out of it.### i, i really do.	###i mean i love --n4049f0 to make things from scratch, you know. --n404a1b making breads###.###uh-huh.
87631:39	###.###oh.###.###and it's like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake. um, which --n4055e3 is really not such a bad price.###i decided i, i just couldn't quite make myself, um, buy it because i do make cheesecake###and somehow i didn't want --n405815 to do that because it,###.###there you go --n4058bf.###.###but i was very tempted because it looked wonderful,	###.###oh.###.
87676:41	###.###this is the southwest,###this is, you know, chips and picante sauce and anything hot.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know you can always make it hotter, and, and lots of stuff like that, you know,###.###right.###.	###.###yeah.###.
87686:4	###so. that's, um, a really good party time, eating all that hot food###.###yeah.###.### and, and they just love it, you know, down here.###it just just, you know,###.###we like hot food too,###so.###.	###so.###.###right.
87740:70	###okay,###china cry was basically the, the true story written by this, this lady who --n400124 had, uh, was a native, a native chinese, uh, uh, who --n40017b was raised --n40018a by christian parents.###.###uh-huh.###.###and her, her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution.###.###i see.###.###although she, herself, had never really accepted jesus or gone through any of the other, uh, christian, uh, portions of, of the faith, repentance, baptisms, et cetera, et cetera. she had always felt a very strong, uh, leaning in this direction.	###.###uh-huh.###.
87747:69	###i see.###.###although she, herself, had never really accepted jesus or gone through any of the other, uh, christian, uh, portions of, of the faith, repentance, baptisms, et cetera, et cetera. she had always felt a very strong, uh, leaning in this direction.###and whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred --n40072f and most churches were either banned --n40074e or their, all the clergy and so forth were killed --n40078d or, or imprisoned --n4007b0 or, and the property confiscated --n4007db, she was safe because she had, you know, not officially joined the, the christian movement.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, anyway, she, as she grew up towards maturity, her parents,###well, her dad was a doctor### and, and he was rather well, you know, rather well --n400c1f to do in the old regime	###you know, the bourgeoisie was, was, was definitely out of, uh, style, then.###.###right.
87761:141	###.###everybody was back to a commonality of one.###and so they kept --n401064 picking at him, picking at his, at her mother and, uh, finally, uh, started --n4010bb picking on her. and getting her to, you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###they were starting --n401281 to, uh, accuse her of, of, of, uh, crimes and atrocities before the, the revolution and, and had her write her own story over and over and over.###uh, and the, uh, the major point of the movie was that, that she had, uh, married this, this chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court --n401591.###now, i think i'm leaving out a portion.### she gr-, she went through college and graduated --n4017f7 very high up in her class and had, uh, gotten a job as, as an instructor	###.###uh-huh.###.

89954:44	###okay,###well the topic is selecting care for the elderly.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i don't have elderly parents, yet###but not that far in the distant future.###what about yourself.###.###well, my parents are both in their seventies.	###and, my, uh, uh, father and stepmother are not in very good health.###so this is something that --n4003e5 is,###.
89975:152	###yes,###they are.###.###oh.###.###they are.###.###have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that.###.###not for them,	###it's got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms### and, and, uh, they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen.### and, and, uh, my father bought this, uh, my stepfather bought this --n400bcf thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care --n400c0e
89977:31	###.###oh.###.###they are.###.###have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that.###.###not for them,### my, my mother and stepfather have, have, uh, set up an arrangement where they have a large home and, uh, two of my sisters and, and their families, one of them's husband and then all the children are living in this home --n400812.###it's got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms	### and, and, uh, my father bought this, uh, my stepfather bought this --n400bcf thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care --n400c0e###and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home.###.
89993:95	### unless, unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that --n400ea7 could not be given --n400ebe in the home.###.###well, even at that point, most care can be given --n400ffb at, in the home.###that sound like just an excellent solution.###you must feel real good about that.###.###well, i, i felt good about it because that's my personal feeling also.### i, uh, i read a lot###and then i know people th-, then --n401321 have visited nursing homes and, uh, have had great, grandparents in the nursing homes###and it was not a happy situation for, for any of them.	###and they have, uh,###even the people that --n401732 are wheelchair bound and, and really are, are ti-, ti-, incapacitated. go and, uh, participate in olympics###.
90003:77	### and, and, uh, we have a very active nursing home here in plano that, that --n40158e has, uh, activities going all the time###and they have, uh,###even the people that --n401732 are wheelchair bound and, and really are, are ti-, ti-, incapacitated. go and, uh, participate in olympics###.###uh-huh.###.###and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that --n401943's held --n401952 annually at a big mall here.###.###right.###.	###and this is a nursing home,###it's not a senior citizens home.###so that the people are really, uh,
90077:17	###and then she was upset,###he had on two different shoes, one of which --n4033d4 was not even his.###he had on a pair, of slacks,###.###oh.###.###and the wife said" these are not his slacks"###and she said" i just took two pair --n4035b5 over yesterday for him that --n4035d0 were clean."###and,###.	###.###right.###.
90102:13	###.###oh.###.###and, with just a curtain, of course, between us and, and, uh,###.###right.###.### th-, they re-, revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth,###and he was definitely,###just by --n403cf3 looking at him and the way he acted --n403d1e, you could tell he was in need of, of nursing home care,	###they said he will not go back to that one.###.###well, good.
90117:59	###.###good,###i'm glad they have a solution.### to do that,###.###i'm glad they the option.###.###yes.###i know.###.	###and there were not, there was no choice.###.###exactly.
90129:34	###.###exactly.### my, uh, my ex-husband's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for, oh, it must be --n404435 seven, eight years,### and, uh, and, uh, it's just her, her condition deteriorated, deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home.###.###oh, my.###.###.###um.###.	###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.
90129:83	###.###exactly.### my, uh, my ex-husband's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for, oh, it must be --n404435 seven, eight years,### and, uh, and, uh, it's just her, her condition deteriorated, deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home.###.###oh, my.###.###.###um.###.	###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.
90276:38	###but it's, uh, it's about, it's a real good book that a guy --n40265e, uh, wrote --n402675 who --n402680 was, uh, a research librarian,###he wrote, uh, sort of --n402828 debunking many of the, uh, uh, mumblex the stories about the, uh, bermuda triangle. you know,### he, he was thinking many, many of the the myths, many of the myths of the triangle were, uh, actually, could be explained --n402a47,###.###uh.###.###.###explained mumblex,###.### and, you know. uh, and the rea-, reason i was, mumblex picked it back up --n402cbe was in light of all the, uh, mumblex well when they found the, uh, the airplanes on the, in the atlantic, --n402d49 thinking they were flight nineteen --n402d68.	###but it's, uh,###flight nineteen was one of the, uh, was a, a collection of a flight of five navy adventures at the end of world war two. right after world war two,###and they were, they were lost --n4032fd
90336:51	###that is for sure.###.###yeah.###so, that is pretty much for right now,###that is, what i have been reading --n40462b.###.###yeah.###.###i kind of like --n4046c6 to read different stuff###and, uh, i like --n40474c to read a novel every now and then,	###.###right.###well, i, i guess i just have not read anyth-,
90442:44	###.###but i, i'm interested in a lot of that,###but, uh, i have got a lot of books that i, i intend --n40672e to read --n40673d,###but i have not been able --n406844 to yet, you know, for one reason or another.###.###like, what is a book on your list --n406951,###you know i have a list too###and i have never gotten to it.###.###oh, gosh, i do not, i do not really have a list,	###i have book shelves###and i have them all out###and usually when i am through with one --n406d21, i will go in and, uh, uh, uh, look, look through, uh,
90444:16	###but, uh, i have got a lot of books that i, i intend --n40672e to read --n40673d,###but i have not been able --n406844 to yet, you know, for one reason or another.###.###like, what is a book on your list --n406951,###you know i have a list too###and i have never gotten to it.###.###oh, gosh, i do not, i do not really have a list,###cause i just kind of, uh, i just have all the books out, you know,###i have book shelves	###and usually when i am through with one --n406d21, i will go in and, uh, uh, uh, look, look through, uh,###i have one now###and i, i can not remember the name of it that i, that i got --n406f0d is
90565:51	###you're right, right.###.###and the teacher kept --n401de0 saying, oh, he has a may birthday.###he's just immature.###.###right.###.###well, second grade it was --n401efd,###i will,###these teachers as far as i'm concerned are absolute saints, because in second grade, it was about the second week of school, i went up there,	###.###good,###good,
90592:88	###.###so she, she was able --n4026eb to zero in.###.###yep,###.###oh.###.###she had already picked it up.###and she said, you know, we, we were going --n40284b to call you if you hadn't called us.###we think there's a learning disability	###.###huh.###.
90763:16	###the other thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education, and is that child.###.###right,###.###.###well, you see that with the foreigners that --n406295 come here.###.###that's right.###.###um, i, i was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they, where they said that, you know, these children, they, they had --n4063f7 to be the best --n40640e,	###.###that's right,###that's right.
90763:25	###the other thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education, and is that child.###.###right,###.###.###well, you see that with the foreigners that --n406295 come here.###.###that's right.###.###um, i, i was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they, where they said that, you know, these children, they, they had --n4063f7 to be the best --n40640e,	###.###that's right,###that's right.
90787:15	###.###sure,###sure,###i think it --n4069b3's real important to have friends.###i think it --n406a71's real important to play sports.###i think it --n406b2f's real important to be part of a team.###.###right.###.###and so that's why i said, their childhood is extremely different from mine --n406c5e.	###.###right.###.
90829:13	###the###my mother's side of the family is quite large, or well, was quite large at one time,###and, uh, they, uh, for as long as i can remember, have had, uh, a yearly reunion,###um, back, uh, early on they used --n400374 to, to rotate them from hou-, from som-, to, to different people's houses, in the family.###.###uh-huh.###.###and,###.###all local.	###.###uh, no, no not, no,###this was, well,
90937:28	###uh, father's.###my mother's father's family had quite a few, uh, brothers and sisters.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, it was a large reunion of, of, of that group, uh, from that descendants.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, a lot of those people have,	###.###right,###right.
90956:34	###uh-huh.###.###and so, uh, it's not quite as close as it used --n402677 to be.###so, i think people feel less of a desire to really go.###i know that,###.### wh-, why do you think that it's less close than it used --n40287f to be --n402892.###.###well, i, i just think that, uh, you know, at that ti-,### when, when they were a-,	### and or they were all in the same ar-, geographical location.###.###uh-huh,
90957:23	###.###and so, uh, it's not quite as close as it used --n402677 to be.###so, i think people feel less of a desire to really go.###i know that,###.### wh-, why do you think that it's less close than it used --n40287f to be --n402892.###.###well, i, i just think that, uh, you know, at that ti-,### when, when they were a-,###you know, the, those were all brothers and sisters a lot	###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh,
90963:86	###.###well, i, i just think that, uh, you know, at that ti-,### when, when they were a-,###you know, the, those were all brothers and sisters a lot### and or they were all in the same ar-, geographical location.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.	###.###right,###right.
91086:75	###and then, about twice a year then you are kept --n405bd0 up with what --n405be3 is going on###and when you meet them at the reunion --n405cc4, you do not feel like, i do not know anything about this person.###you have, read something about what --n405dfc is going on and about their children and so forth.###.###that's a good idea.###.###so, you are kind of, half way acquainted that way.###.###right.###.	###.###yeah.###.
91460:20	###oh. well, tell me,###what books have you read --n400a9a lately..###.###well, let's see,### i, um, gosh, i can't even think.###i haven't read any,###and you're such a reader,###i know that###and i,###.	###i mean, i read a lot for school,###but gee, i just don't have much time for enjoyment reading.###.
91477:23	###uh-huh.###.###and it was, um, it was called --n401011, um, smart women, i think. um, or something like that.###.###um.###.###.###yeah.###.###and it was, it was kind of,	###.###huh.###.
91485:11	###.###and it was, it was kind of,###i really didn't like it at all.###.###huh.###.### it was, it was written --n4012ba back in the early eighties.###.###oh, yeah.###.	###.###oh, yeah.###.
91503:11	###it was really an interesting,###because i, i right away looked at when it was copyrighted --n40161c --n401623. because i could tell by the theme of almost when it was written --n401662 --n401669.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yes,###yes,###yeah.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
91715:54	###.###oh, how neat.###.###and i've,###yeah,###it's really neat because these are brand new books###and i, just got a, i got a, th-, this one,###.###oh, great.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
91768:64	###and he really, this man really shed some light on, um, some, aspects of of bach's genius and, and, and, you know, the, and more sociological things, you know, like the, the idea that, um, that music, to be a musician was as much, um, of a family occupation as anything.###.###yeah.###.###i mean, you know, that was it was families had just loads of musicians.###.###yes.###.###.###yeah,	###.###yeah.###.
91875:13	###um, well, where, where, for instance, um, a baudelaire poem that --n408099 was written --n4080a8, in the french and then has been translated --n4080d3 into english by, various people.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###oh, i see.###.	###.###all different.###.
91885:30	###and the translations are all so different from one another.###.###all different.###.###uh-huh.###.###oh, that's interesting.###.###so it's multiple translations of single works### and, and that's right now, right now pretty much what i'm doing --n40846c as far as, um,	###.###gosh.###.
91932:26	###on my father's side we've really there, uh,###.###uh-huh.###.###on my mother's side we've had several,### not, it's not really on a regular basis,###.###uh-huh.###.###but usually sometimes every few summers.	###.###right.###.

92176:30	###.###right.###.### and, and, uh, it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping --n40532b.###and, uh, we had --n405456 to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them###and i told him,###.### have you, have you done this repetitively, or just once.###.###we did it that year,	###we sent invitations.###we said," please let us know if you're coming."###it was when, uh, his mother, his step father had died the year before --n40584e,
92231:14	###well, see, we manage, those people who --n4066b3 are at that core group manage --n4066d6 to keep, keep the vigor alive.###they'll send out news bulletins.###two or three times a year you'll get a news bull-,###hey, guess who --n406921 got, you know, elected --n406940 to the legislature,###or guess who our local sheriff,###.###.###okay.###.###okay,	###.###recently,###my most recent trip was last year,

92466:52	###so that was, that, that's a nice place.###canada is very nice.###.###yeah,###that would be nice.###i had a friend from there.###.###uh-huh.###.###then i, i'd love --n40473a to go somewhere in asia,	###.###oh, yes,###absolutely.
92466:61	###so that was, that, that's a nice place.###canada is very nice.###.###yeah,###that would be nice.###i had a friend from there.###.###uh-huh.###.###then i, i'd love --n40473a to go somewhere in asia,	###.###oh, yes,###absolutely.
92554:30	### i'd, i'd love --n405c7d to go back there.###there's just not time.###there's not enough time to go --n405d99 see everything, and then to afford --n405dbc to see everything.###.###i guess that's why we need --n405eb6 to plan for retirement --n405ecd, so when we do have the free time --n405ef8, we'll have the, the means to, uh, pursue our dreams --n405f43.###.###right.###that's,###.###yeah.	###.###.###that and sleeping late.

92649:77	###.###we're just,###i'm sorry they're breaking the team up, because we liked all the ones that --n400cf0 were on there.###.###i know.###i'm amazed.###.###i'm not sure i like the new ones too much.###.###huh-uh.	###.###i just wonder if, if, uh, they just want --n4010c4 to go on to other projects and not be stuck --n4010f3 in this show, since it's gone on for so long,### it looks like, it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things. where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show --n401304.
92668:20	###.###.###i know.###.###of course, i guess that's not bad.###alan alda did it on mash.###.###i know.###isn't that funny.###.	###so do you, do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that --n4016b9 lasts an hour.###.###oh, i don't usually like stuff that --n4017ff continues.
92696:57	###right,###which they do --n401e66 at the beginning of the season, --n401e89 to grab your attention. you know,###.###.###uh-huh.###.###that's always a bummer too.###.###i know.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
92715:40	###yeah.###.###so i like things like golden girls or cheers###or, uh, monday night is real good with me, you know,###major dad and, and, uh, northern exposure and, and, uh,###oh, what's that one with burt reynolds --n4026d6.###that type of show is what we what, uh, we watch --n402772.###.###uh-huh.###.	###just some of the times they're continued --n4029a0,###but mostly they're just little vignettes.###a new one we found --n402a85 we really like --n402a9c is that dinosaurs.
92750:32	###but it, it's real,###the first one we saw --n40330b, um, they were, it, it involved a tradition of when a per-, person reaches seventy-five --n40337a,###and i can't remember what day they call it --n403509,### but, but, uh, the son-in-laws get --n4035aa to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five --n4035d5 over a cliff.###.###oh, great.###.### anyway, anyway, it, it goes on, you know,###.###.	###and then when it comes time for him to throw her over --n4038ad, well, the, the teenaged son the night before tried --n4038e4 to save her by --n4038fb hiding her.###.###oh.
92796:10	###.###oh, he doesn't.###and, of course, the town thinks he's just terrible, because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it.###and then we saw one where this, there was a teenage, when a teenage boy comes into his manhood --n40491c,###.###they call it the night of the howling, or something like that,###.###uh-huh.###.###.	### and, and the son refused --n404bbb to do it.### he, he did,###.
92810:21	###he thought it was not...###.###speakerb81-1*t81-1.###so he didn't go --n404d25 howl.###speakeranan*t81-1.###speakera81-2*t81-2.###no,###he wouldn't go --n404da6 howl,###speakerbnan*t81-2.###.	###.###speakerb83-1*t83-1.###oh, how funny.
92843:26	###speakerbnan*t88-1.###speakerb88-2*t88-2.###it's just a half hour,###speakeranan*t88-2.###.###or is it hour.###.###well, half hour.###.###oh.	###.###speakera92-1*t92-1.### and, and, uh, they...
92867:150	###.### it, it, they, they're trying --n405985 to liken the, the father in there of the teenage son --n4059bc to like jackie gleason show. uh, the way he talks to his mother-in-law --n405a03 and so forth,###.###uh-huh.###and i guess maybe there are some parts of that,###but i didn't really see that in there.###but what i've read --n405d4c about it, they talk about that.###but anyway, we've, we've enjoyed that,###.###speakera96-1*t96-1.	###speakerbnan*t96-1.###speakerb96-2*t96-2.###yeah,
92940:26	###speakera109-2*t109-2.###no.###speakerbnan*t109-2.###.### it's, it's, uh,###that's why i don't get --n406faa to watch that much --n406fc1.###.###i mean, i, watch nine o'clock###.###right.	###.###but before that, i really, there's not much time.###.
93061:44	###um.###.###and she had this fantastic, um, family effort in, in recycling,###and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics, and her aluminum,###.###oh.###.###and i thought wow, i mean, how, one person is doing that, you know,###but my, my thought was it's a shame,###i mean, it --n4015a2's wonderful that she's doing it and it,	###because her effort would have really, um, really, uh, been a good example for all of us.### and yet, you know, and we were just sort of talking about it at the time.###and here we are --n401985, you know,
93062:53	###.###and she had this fantastic, um, family effort in, in recycling,###and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics, and her aluminum,###.###oh.###.###and i thought wow, i mean, how, one person is doing that, you know,###but my, my thought was it's a shame,###i mean, it --n4015a2's wonderful that she's doing it and it,###but wouldn't it be mu-, much nicer if we all did it,	### and yet, you know, and we were just sort of talking about it at the time.###and here we are --n401985, you know,###now we're doing it on a, city wide basis in, in communities.
93269:52	###yeah.###.###.###well, i don't know, you know.### i, i wonder how, how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to, to make this whole thing work. i mean, the extra like washing out bottles and jars, or the extra of actually, uh, making sure that, uh, you take stuff over to, you know --n4052dc,###some people are compl-, now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked --n4055d8 up at the curbside, you know,###.###.###and i think golly moses, you just do your part.###you know, people are not,	###.###right.###well, see, this, this is what --n4059fb concerns me.
93311:72	###yeah.###.### and, and, and i, i think you have --n40610b to get into a period of need, bef-,###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
93311:94	###yeah.###.### and, and, and i, i think you have --n40610b to get into a period of need, bef-,###.###yeah,###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
93401:50	###.###.### i, i think the big question --n407c6a too we're looking at --n407c89 is, would you be willing --n407ca8 to pay more for a product, so it can be recycled --n407cdf.###.###yeah.###.###.###well, i think that may, that's kind of what it's coming to --n407ebc, i'm sure --n407ed7.###.### that's, that's right	###.###yeah.###.
93537:61	###uh, we usually book just a month before it's ready --n401b60 to go.###.###yeah.###.###and we get upgraded --n401c33.### last ti-, last two times, in fact, we had an outside room###and it was beautiful.###.###um.###.	###it's kind of,###.###well, what do you do --n401f11 on a cruise.
93547:21	###and we like --n401d9b not having --n401daa to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around.###it's kind of,###.###well, what do you do --n401f11 on a cruise.###i've never been on a cruise.###.###oh, my god, you do everything.###.###.### you, i mean, you can be as busy as you want --n40208a to be, or as laid back as you want --n4020bd to be.	###or you can take part in the games that they have --n4022d1 going on.###they always have bingo.###they have a casino.
93580:10	### we, we've gone with friends each time.###.###i see.###.###and then we went to, uh, the western caribbean, which --n4029fa is, uh, port, uh, cancun, cozumel, and ocho rios.###.###oh, the, the mexican coast.###.### pardon me.###.	###.###yes,###uh-huh.
93660:13	###uh-huh.###.###my husband would, you know,###the minute i said the word --n4041e1, he, he, he's chomping at the bit.###.###.###he kind of likes the casinos a little bit.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###what's the best part --n40440d, from your point of view.###.
93703:80	###.###yeah.###.###but the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of texas in the summer###so,###.###isn't that the truth,###uh-huh.###.###huh. well, that sounds wonderful.	###.###well, there's all age grou-, groups too,###and that's, that's kind of fun.
93705:15	###.###but the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of texas in the summer###so,###.###isn't that the truth,###uh-huh.###.###huh. well, that sounds wonderful.### i, i guess i, i would contemplate --n4050d2 going on a cruise, uh, oh, all circumstances permitting it.###.	###and that's, that's kind of fun.###uh, you, if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals, you meet different people.###.
93797:45	###yeah.###.###.###we really hope, hope so.###.###well, that, that's really great.###uh,###.###yeah.###.	###and, uh,###.###well, that, that's, that's pretty good.
93908:52	###uh-huh.###.###.###right,###i'm twenty-two.###.###and so, it --n401903's interesting that as you get older you begin --n40192e to understand that you need --n401949 to exercise.###.###right.###.	###.###right.###.
93928:22	###or i'll just get nuts###.###right.###.###so that's kind of a motivator,###so even though i can look at it as a task, the, you know, i kind of get the, i get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by --n401fa1 saying, well, i'm lowering my chance of heart attack, and thus, that type stuff.###.###right.###.###.	###.###sure,###that all,
93931:8	###.###so that's kind of a motivator,###so even though i can look at it as a task, the, you know, i kind of get the, i get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by --n401fa1 saying, well, i'm lowering my chance of heart attack, and thus, that type stuff.###.###right.###.###.### eating right and no cholesterol and all that.###.###sure,	### i, i do all that.###.###yeah,
93932:25	###so that's kind of a motivator,###so even though i can look at it as a task, the, you know, i kind of get the, i get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by --n401fa1 saying, well, i'm lowering my chance of heart attack, and thus, that type stuff.###.###right.###.###.### eating right and no cholesterol and all that.###.###sure,###that all,	###.###yeah,###we,
94034:63	###but also, uh, that, that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles.###.###right,###that's it,###i do the occasional push up and sit up.###i haven't really brought myself to go to the the gym, because that's very stressful to me,###.###yeah.###.###because i feel, i felt real competitive there,	###.###oh, yeah,### i don't, i don't let that bother me,
94184:73	###.###uh, we're not, uh, real wealthy at the moment.###last time i had people over for dinner --n400609 we had lasagna,###and i used my mother's recipe,###i really like it.###it's got, um,###you cook the noodles and make, and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it###and, i'm not sure she even puts,### must be some italian spices in there.###i can't remember.	###.###well, that sounds good.###.
94280:7	###.###you take a flour tortilla###and you fry it like a taco shell###.###okay.###.###.###right.###.###and you, uh,	### and, and i like --n402576 to just add picante sauce --n402591 to get the mexican flavor###so you don't have --n40266e to mess with spices and stuff.###.
94447:28	###yeah.###.###poultry instead of the beef and pork,###.### less cho-, less cholesterol. yeah,###.###yeah.###.###right,###right.	###.###yeah,### i, i can't think of any other specific things i like --n405533 to serve --n405542.
94580:49	###wow.###.###i think normal's about sixty or seventy.###.###yeah,###well, i guess, um, ours probably isn't that big.###our family is dwindling, for one thing.###.###oh.###.	###.###oh.###.
94633:58	###.###some of the people come down on friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend,###.###uh-huh.###.###and some just come in for saturday###.###uh-huh.###.###so, it, uh, has worked out quite well,	###.###uh-huh###.
94661:30	###oh.###.###.###yeah,###yeah### that, that is a problem with the distance.###the people that we have --n40336d that --n403378 don't come are out el paso way###.###yeah.###.	###.###it --n403565's an, all day drive just to get to this area.###.
94661:42	###oh.###.###.###yeah,###yeah### that, that is a problem with the distance.###the people that we have --n40336d that --n403378 don't come are out el paso way###.###yeah.###.	###.###it --n403565's an, all day drive just to get to this area.###.
94663:18	###.###yeah,###yeah### that, that is a problem with the distance.###the people that we have --n40336d that --n403378 don't come are out el paso way###.###yeah.###.###and it --n403463's just too much for all of them, all of that group to travel.###.	###.###.###right.
94692:61	###.###uh-huh.###.###and a number of years ago, back in the early eighties, my wife was president.###we discovered how much work it --n403b3b is --n403b46 just to organize --n403b5d and get --n403b6c --n403b73 it together.###and it takes a lot of planning, and assembling of stuff.###.###uh-huh.###.###.	###.###.###right.
94717:57	###i don't really care for her to be president again.###.###no.###.###but that is, uh, it's, it's a lot of work,###but it's a lot of fun.###.###uh-huh.###.###we've enjoyed it,	###.###well, i think,###.
94726:17	###we've enjoyed it,###and the grandkids really enjoy it because it's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from oklahoma --n404262.###.###well, i think,###.###.###yeah,###and it's, it --n4043bb's good for kids to know that they have other family.###.###yeah,	###the show this weekend,###this weekend's going --n404586 to be a rock and roll show###.
94878:27	###right,###.###.###right.###.###and i wonder if, not so much that, uh,###.###well, i think it's, like you say, it's, it's the socioeconomic mix### there, you know, the, they're,###you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids who --n402ada are basically, uh, that --n402afd might be more well to-, well off, you know, going to a private catholic school or whatever --n402b58, uh,	###but, you know, some that --n402df2 are um, that, they're, they're not quite the same as the kids that --n402e51 are going to the inner city, uh, you know, public schools.###.###yeah.
94956:28	###yeah.###.###i could see where that would be a problem --n405efe,###and i think that's, i think it's...###.###.###okay.###.###okay,###i,	###so, i am assisting them with their children in their selections,###.###uh-huh.
95028:137	###yeah,###in other words, there're more people,###.###they're dealt --n401301 with, in packages.###.###.###yes,###yes.### that's, that's an interesting point of view.###i, uh, you know,	###.###uh-huh.###.
95028:281	###yeah,###in other words, there're more people,###.###they're dealt --n401301 with, in packages.###.###.###yes,###yes.### that's, that's an interesting point of view.###i, uh, you know,	###.###uh-huh.###.
95070:26	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###i recently stopped by mcdonalds,###and i was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things, and was visiting with another mother who --n4022f8 was there with her children,###and she was telling me that she was given --n402449 the opportunity to manage a day care center --n402478,###and of course, she was, she had just gotten her degree,###and she was so enthusiastic,###and she was excited about it	###.###yes,###yes,
95443:57	###i'm not familiar with that.###.###.###so i don't, i don't use, i mean,###you can call it word processing,###but i don't usually use a word processor --n401b33 to do it###.###uh-huh###.###and we don't have too much standard software.	###so we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that.###we use it more for just writing programs when we need --n401e39 to --n401e48 or, um, doing research, looking at the speech signal and then doing writing, and also as a just as a terminal,###and we connect to other computers --n402058 to read our net mail and things like that.
95661:28	###so, i, i, uh, i, i, i feel like it should be mandatory in some professions,###and i think if, if, uh, an employer feels that he wants --n400692 to, to drug test employees and they don't like it, then they should not be employed --n4006e5 there.###that was,###you know, i would not mind it.###.###yeah,### i, i especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause somebody else, you know harm or injury --n40099f, absolutely.###.###right.###.	###but i, i, i don't, i don't have a problem with them --n400c44 too much, testing even after the fact,###but i do a little bit where it, where it wouldn't hurt anybody --n400ddd.###i don't know,
95855:23	### i, i just think employers have --n404305 to have, especially given today, the drug abuse that --n404340 goes on, i just think employers have --n40436b to have some kind of way to see that they're not being put --n4043b6 at risk --n4043c5. because they're the ones who --n4043e8 are going --n4043f7 to have the lawsuits, the insurance claims, et cetera,###.###put at risk.###.###.###i agree totally.###.###.### and, and i'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to, uh, illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse.###.	###.###right.###.
96046:17	###.###uh-huh.###.###it was the late, well###i guess it would have been, i will take that back, it must have been in the forties, because they had been married, uh, probably fifteen years at the time.###and, it --n40282d was just, uh, fascinating to see how little things cost --n402868,###i mean it was, it was just almost laughable in some instances that, you know,###.###oh.###.	###.###i know.###right.
96457:189	###and it's, uh, called --n402eb2 that because it's at the very end of, uh, a jetty there, which --n402efd is, uh, sort of at the end of this little, little point###.###okay.###.###and, uh, it's a, at the very end,###it's the last set of condominiums there,###and it's, uh, it's very nice. uh,###it's not very expensive, uh,###you can,###i think we are going --n403334 to go with another couple and their kids.	###.###right.###.
96567:34	###right.###.### we will head for, we will head for florida, maybe in somewhat of an off season, instead of summer.###.###right.###.###so, uh.###.###okay.###.	###.###okay.###.
97004:45	###.###but i enjoy --n407372 receiving them.###.###yeah,###well, that's good,###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###that's good,	###.###.###uh-huh,
97302:13	###.###but, i, i do know that in raising my boys, i really did meet a lot of pressures saying, you know, you need --n4035c0 to get them into music lessons,###you need --n403759 to get them, into sports###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###you need --n403811 to get them into this,###they need --n403895 to be busy###and they need --n4038fc to be active.	###i said if those boys want --n4039e1 to be involved --n4039f4 in that they will come to me###and they will say mom this is important to me,###i want --n403b6e to do it,
97419:12	###um. well, in the first place it's not your homework,###it's your children's homework.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i was always very careful --n4054f8 to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help --n405537,###.###uh-huh.###.###i helped them with exactly what they asked for --n40565b	###.###yeah.###.
97460:48	###.###uh-huh.###.###i do not know why god made women brilliant --n405d1a.###i,###.###didn't he though.###.###yes,###but i do not know	###they, are all things to all people,###.###that's very true.
97461:12	###uh-huh.###.###i do not know why god made women brilliant --n405d1a.###i,###.###didn't he though.###.###yes,###but i do not know###they tend --n405e5c to look at the mother as the one who --n405e87 solves all problems.	###.###that's very true.###.
97461:20	###uh-huh.###.###i do not know why god made women brilliant --n405d1a.###i,###.###didn't he though.###.###yes,###but i do not know###they tend --n405e5c to look at the mother as the one who --n405e87 solves all problems.	###.###that's very true.###.
97496:79	###.###and she said, it's amazing, she said --n406675, you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###every single person in this family expects me to get,###and they dra-, suck me into these arguments and, these conversations###.###that's right.###.	###and she said i am not doing it anymore.### i, i just,###.
97528:8	###because, the mediator is an unbiased bystander who,###.###.###okay,###so what were you saying --n400040.###.### do you work with, do you work around children when you work --n4000c4.###.###no,###no,	###i work with computers.###.###with computers.
97565:8	###too much about child care in new york.###.###does the company you work for --n4006a8 have, child care on premises for, employees.###.###.### excuse me one second.###.###.###huh-uh.###no,	###in fact my situation is a little bit strange,###i was, uh, a student for many years, and then graduated and went and worked in france for awhile.###and, i, have just come back and was doing consulting work.
97642:44	###.###maybe if i needed --n401a0f to work part time, like four hours a day, i might do that, cause like, you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time.###but, uh, i just think that, you know, when there's two year olds running around --n401c27, the, whoever --n401c46 is taking care of, the care givers are going --n401c79 to pay attention to the two year olds.###.###that's right.###.###and only when the infant screams --n401eb8, are they going --n401ecf to go there,###.###that's right.###.	###.###right.###.
97687:42	###and some were just different objects that --n402eca have, had a definite purpose for kids, you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###and there's something about their eyes.###.###yeah,###.###uh,###.	###.###how old is she --n4031f0.###.
97765:10	###that's nice when, uh,### i, my, i have three grandchildren,###another one coming in september,###and i,### it would, if they were where i could not get my hands on them --n4047df, i am afraid i would probably go crazy.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, i, i like that,###.	###.###but if, it you do not have --n404a5b to put them in child care, that's, that's an ideal situation for you, is to stay with them as,###or you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time.
97768:57	###and i,### it would, if they were where i could not get my hands on them --n4047df, i am afraid i would probably go crazy.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, i, i like that,###.###are they all nearby.###.###but if, it you do not have --n404a5b to put them in child care, that's, that's an ideal situation for you, is to stay with them as,	###.###yeah.###.
97932:17	###speakera158-1*t158-1.###right.###speakerbnan*t158-1.###speakerb158-2*t158-2.###and that's a problem,###society is geared to a, a day person###and it's,###i have another friend whose brother and his wife --n4075e3 have done this,###speakeranan*t158-2.###.	###.###.###okay.
97966:12	###of course, now fifty percent divorces in the united states, uh,###my mother, uh, was treated --n400706 very badly, uh, in a, by a lot of people, family members, um, especially from my father's side of the family,###and also, uh, uh, uh, we were, uh, ostracized --n400916 by his family, uh,###basically just, you know, uh, we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.	###.###oh, mercy.###.
98293:42	###that is one i've been dying --n4007d3 to see --n4007e2.###.###at the same time, it had a story line about people trying to find themselves.###there were parts that --n400974 were sad.###i mean, it just ran the gamut of emotion.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh,###and,###.	###.###how long did that movie run --n400bbe.###.
98521:14	###it was on t v recently, uh,###fatal attraction.###.###uh-huh.###.###it's one that, once you've seen it once and, uh, the suspense there is not really, you really can't see --n4042a2 it again###.###right,###okay.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
98734:22	###.###.###yeah,### i, i, i think, i agree with you there.###.###because it just was not, uh, something back in the sixties that uh, i even had --n402730 to worry about --n402743.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i think, you know, that there is a lot in the society where things have changed --n402895,	###.###uh-huh.###yeah,
98899:19	###.###and, you know, the guy went free because this was twelve years ago thirteen years ago,###.###uh-huh.###.###there was no,###his father was even, the, uh, police chief of the town.###.###uh-huh.###.	###but he was uninsured.###.###yeah.
98907:39	###uh-huh.###.###so there was no repercussion at all. you know, other than insurance,###but he was uninsured.###.###yeah.###.###so, uh, our insurance paid for everything,###but it was a very difficult time### and, and then later, this was actually funny, my brother and i were picked --n406a45 up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a, a new car	###.###uh-huh.###.
99042:24	###.###right.### well, well, also what i don't think --n403301 is fair, either, is when you have like a, say a rapist, come in --n403350,### and, and his attorney gets his sentences, sentencing reduced --n4034ef because he's gone to a lesser charge, like, i don't know what, assault or something or,###.###uh-huh.###.###but, which that doesn't make any sense to me either.###i know it --n40376c's hard to prove rape and whatnot### and, and, and the person that --n403852 was raped --n403861 or whatever doesn't,	###.###uh-huh.###.
99049:54	###but, which that doesn't make any sense to me either.###i know it --n40376c's hard to prove rape and whatnot### and, and, and the person that --n403852 was raped --n403861 or whatever doesn't,###i mean it's embarrassing and all this other stuff###.###uh-huh.###.###and they, they're put on --n403a0d like, they were the ones that --n403a30 caused it or whatever,###but, to me, when you do the crime --n403b57, then you should pay for whatever you did --n403b82,### and, and you shouldn't be able --n403c73 to go on the lesser charge.	###i can go out and do it again and, you know have the same thing happen.###.###yeah.
99069:148	###.###right.###.###if it's first degree rape, second deg-, degree rape or whatever, they only get --n4044f7 to decide on that,###well, okay this person has been charged --n404613 with first degree rape, uh,###and you can decide guilt or innocence on that.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, such like, maybe in murder they get --n40476c to choose whether it's, uh, premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees.	###.###yeah.###.
99077:70	###.###uh, such like, maybe in murder they get --n40476c to choose whether it's, uh, premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees.###the other thing that juries are restricted --n4048c4 on --n4048cf and, and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things in my, even in my own experiences, that you usually don't get --n40495a to hear all the information.###.###yeah.###.###it's what information --n404b68 is presented --n404b77###and, uh, i don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards,###but often juries hear only a fraction of the, of the story when they have --n404d64 to decide guilt or innocence --n404d7f.###.	###somebody thinks it, it had, because they've got it there.###.###uh-huh.
99082:50	###.###it's what information --n404b68 is presented --n404b77###and, uh, i don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards,###but often juries hear only a fraction of the, of the story when they have --n404d64 to decide guilt or innocence --n404d7f.###.###and to me, how can you, how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of, whether it be, whether it pertains to the case or not --n404f1f,###somebody thinks it, it had, because they've got it there.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah,###and the truth that --n405301's brought --n405310 out is, uh, as i say, when i've heard about, you know --n40535b,
99208:54	###.###and you never know that, though sometimes when you're going in --n4029f3, do you.###.###.###no,###but because i sort of stick to several schools, uh, i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and, and might, might remember --n402b4c to do it.###.###right,###right.###.	###.###right.###.
99256:71	###i see that the,###i think the elementary school teachers, or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some of the high school teachers, i think.###.###uh-huh.###.###but it, i think it varies, it, it just so much.### anything, anything can go.###.###uh-huh.###.	###but they're just sort of into clothes,###and then there's other departments that --n40425d aren't.###.
99507:36	###and, uh, you know, --n400ff5 having gone to the university of minnesota, i know what a big university is like --n40103c.###and, uh, one thing that i did --n40114f this summer, which i thought --n401172 might benefit both my daughters is, my youngest daughter got involved --n4011ad in band,###and baylor has a band camp.###.###oh.###.###so she went for a week,###and it was overnight,###and they lived in the dorms.###and i thought this would expose both of them to what it's, you know, like --n40148d on a coll-, a smaller college campus.	###so, uh, i, i, i still think the exposure was good.###.###yes.
99515:25	###and they lived in the dorms.###and i thought this would expose both of them to what it's, you know, like --n40148d on a coll-, a smaller college campus.###and, uh, my oldest one just wasn't impressed --n401604 at all with the idea of a small school.###so, uh, i, i, i still think the exposure was good.###.###yes.###.###the reason i ask if you went to college --n40181e is i thought, well, you know,###what were your selection criteria --n401940.###did you base it on what you wanted --n4019a4 to major in --n4019b7 or what you would feel comfortable with --n4019da or what you could afford --n4019f5	###.###uh-huh.### those, and those were several, uh, that we did consider --n401ca7.
99623:83	###.###yes,###he thinks that's what he'd like --n4043fc to do --n40440b,###but he's really strong in math and science, too,###and we keep --n404542 encouraging him to keep an open mind.###.###huh.###.###does your daughter know what she'd like --n40460f to do --n40461e.###.	###.###yeah.###.
99645:7	###and i made the mistake of --n404c80 dropping out of college --n404c97 to get married.###so i'm trying --n404d5a to have my children not make the same mistake.###and i'm, you know, showing them if you're strong in math and science, kiddos, this is one area where women can make some decent money --n404e84. you know.###.###yes.###.###i mean, i'm kind of really putting the practical application, you know, and, and saying, yet, do something that you enjoy --n405070.###.###uh-huh.###.	###do you just have one son.###.###yes.
99664:36	###now that he's in high school, uh,###and, of course, there's, there is still time,###but he's beginning --n405682 to feel that, as much as he enjoys writing, he wonders if he can make a living at it.###you know, it's, the, it's,###.###.###well, the weather has been, certainly has been hot###and it's been humid.###i don't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high for, uh, this late into, uh,###well, it's not really late into the summer,	###.###yeah.###are you native to this area.
99688:38	### so, uh, but, you know, i know the summers get hot###but it certainly, uh,###.###uh-huh.###.###this humidity has just really hung on there.###.###yeah.###yeah,###it seemed like,	###and this year we really didn't have heavy rains until may.### kind of like pushed the season back a little farther###and now it's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity
99795:41	###.###okay.###.###but, uh, anyway,###so that kind of, uh,###well, i had been down here --n4026bf to visit###so i mumblex school and said hey, let's, you know, find a place that --n402780 has a nice job###and, uh, that's how it worked out --n4028a9.###.###well, yeah,	###and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus.###.###oh, yeah.
99809:19	###.###you know, the, the little joke about, will the last person leaving michigan just turn out the light.###.###oh, well, it's a nice place, you know,###i mean it's, it's a nice, that's a nice place, though.###.###well, you know, i, i said i lived in, uh, the pontiac.###i didn't live in the city of pontiac,###i lived to the west of it.###uh, i forget the, the county,	###.###okay,###sort of.
99818:60	###uh, i forget the, the county,###but you know where all the lakes are --n4030f6 around there.###.###okay,###sort of.###.###i lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes.###it was real close to where i worked --n403278.###it was only like four miles to work###and it --n40335f was wonderful being on the lake like that.	###and everybody's, you know, out enjoying the water and such,###and, uh, in the winter time the lakes froze over,###you could still kind of go --n4036cf sledding and such out there
99822:52	###sort of.###.###i lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes.###it was real close to where i worked --n403278.###it was only like four miles to work###and it --n40335f was wonderful being on the lake like that.###you know, in the summer, you feel like you're, you know, on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake###and everybody's, you know, out enjoying the water and such,###and, uh, in the winter time the lakes froze over,###you could still kind of go --n4036cf sledding and such out there	###there's lots of really small ones out there.###.###yeah.
99845:42	###and it was lots of fun.###.###that's right.###.### lake, i think lake whitmore is the only one i have real memories of --n403b5c. which --n403b6b is,###.###um.###well, i think it's, i think it's toward ann arbor,###so it's probably out in that direction,###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
99860:48	### so, but, uh,###speakerbnan*t64-1.###speakerb64-2*t64-2.###yeah,###speakeranan*t64-2.###.###yeah.###but it was, yeah, just lots of little lakes###and, of course, it --n404030 was, you know, a little more expensive to live on the lake,###but i just thought that was grand.	###but there was quite a few lakes all around there.### it seemed like, it was almost like you were living on an island###there was so much water around where i was --n4044cd.
99861:22	###speakerbnan*t64-1.###speakerb64-2*t64-2.###yeah,###speakeranan*t64-2.###.###yeah.###but it was, yeah, just lots of little lakes###and, of course, it --n404030 was, you know, a little more expensive to live on the lake,###but i just thought that was grand.###and i think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them,	### it seemed like, it was almost like you were living on an island###there was so much water around where i was --n4044cd.###i said i wasn't close to downtown pontiac,
99993:78	###.###like by noon it was gone.###.###.###yeah.###.###speakera98-1*t98-1.###yeah.###speakerbnan*t98-1.###speakerb98-2*t98-2.	###and i was laughing, going yeah, right, that's a good practical joke,###speakeranan*t98-2.###.
100006:17	###.###ha ha.###they said, no really, there's snow###and there was, but a very short time###.###and the weather got warm so quick###.###yeah.###.###speakerb103-1*t103-1.	###speakeranan*t103-1.###speakera103-2*t103-2.###yeah,
100021:45	###speakerbnan*t103-2.###.###i know.###.###speakerb105-1*t105-1.###course, when we get an ice storm --n40629a, that's not too much fun.###speakeranan*t105-1.###speakera105-2*t105-2.###no,###that's not fun either,	###speakerbnan*t105-2.###.### so, but, uh, well we have,
100078:49	###uh-huh.###.###and it's twice a week.###.###uh-huh.###.###really.###we have, recently started, uh, a bin program --n40041d here in plano where, uh,###.###.	###and now they have, uh, these large green containers###and you have --n40071a to put your trash that you don't recycle --n400745 in there.###and then they haven't started curbside recycling yet,
100176:7	###and i was thinking, you know maybe i'd help --n401e4c supplement it, you know when they turned them in --n401e7b###.###uh-huh.###.###but it --n401fa6's amazing how many cans you go through --n401fcd. and how fast they accumulate --n401fec.###.###yeah###it really is.###.###.	###and how much, how much we have reduced our waste. you know, that we, we're generating --n4021a5 a week --n4021b4.###.###uh-huh.
100341:21	###.###oh they do.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh-huh.###and do you have --n4058a5 to sort that.###.###and they will do the alum-,###.	###.###no,###you just put it in the one bin
100381:35	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###my husband would, come home and go through the trash and say, you threw this away.###.###.###uh.###.###.	###and i'd say,###it's just such an automatic reaction.###and now we think before we throw anything away.
100399:53	### we, we really,###once you get into the habit of it, it's okay,### it's just, it's just making it a habit that --n406725's hard.###.###oh, i know.###well the kids have even got to the point where they, if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can, you know, they, they're, oh, no, don't do that --n4068f6###and they go to the sink,###they rinse them out,###and they put them upside down,###they let them drain	###.###uh-huh.###.
100432:21	###.###yeah.###.###that's a lot of fun.###well, that's great.###well i'm --n4070dd to hear you're, doing that.###.###.###i,###my sister --n4071bb was here recently from connecticut	###.###oh really..###.
100477:20	###uh,###.###my husband's family are reaching that point###but it's, it's so difficult.###was she in favor of it### or, or was she kind of opposed to it.###.###well, yeah,###when it finally came down to it --n400f56, um, she just got to the point after the,###i mean, it wasn't a very, um, strong stroke.	###.###uh-huh.###.
100542:18	###yeah.###.###and i'm not near nursing home age.###.###although they've got, uh, meals on wheels, which i understand --n40203f is a really good, you know, way to handle that so that at least they eat --n402096.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.	###or probably in college station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.###.###no,
100565:13	###and then, uh, she wasn't as ambulatory###so they were almost, you know, to the point of --n4027e1 saying she can't be here anymore.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, i remember from her checking around, she ended up --n402919 staying at the arkansas house i think --n402940 out in arlington, something like that.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that --n402afe share uh, a, uh, bathroom.	###.###oh yeah.###that's a given.
100583:22	###uh-huh.###.###.###and sometimes the, the help there does it, i think --n402ff4.###.###uh. so, they, they, uh, don't have too many facilities it seems --n4030ed for their personal items.###very limited space waste###.###uh-huh.###.	###you know, go to the dining room and, and eat some good meals.###.###uh-huh.
100614:47	###but the, the places like presbyterian village and some of the, the retirement places where, where they have different levels of care --n403cab seems --n403cb6 to be so much better, as far as elderly people adapting.###.###uh-huh.###.###they're able --n403ed9 to move in while they're still independent and still social###.###uh-huh.###.### and, and they do group things.###and then if health or, or mental capacity deteriorates, they're able --n404074 to take the next steps without so much change	###it's really kind of difficult.###.###yeah,
100739:11	###she's down in temple###.###uh-huh.###.###and we can't see her often enough --n406687 to really know what --n40669e's going on.###.###um.###.###so, it's difficult,###it really is	###and,###.###yeah,
100759:24	###.###uh-huh.###.###so we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here.###.###yeah.###.###.###okay.###.	###.###.###do you have children.
100772:36	###do you have children.###.###no.###.###no.###okay.###because i, i didn't know if that would make a difference in how you felt --n40020a.###.###yeah.###.	###.###i think it's a good idea.###i think everybody should, should, uh, put in their time so to speak for the, for the good of the, the nation and for the good of themselves.
100780:67	###yeah.###.###um, what do you think --n400319 about the proposal that all young americans should spend a year or two,###.###i think it's a good idea.###i think everybody should, should, uh, put in their time so to speak for the, for the good of the, the nation and for the good of themselves.###.###yeah.###.###i think it's, uh,	###.###i just, um,###i guess that's mumblex, my, that's something that my family has always believed strongly in --n40090b,
100991:22	###.###yes.###.###well,###.###well, i guess, um,###did you have anything else.###.###no,###no	###.###okay.###.
101138:103	###and that's overwhelming.###.###well we've got, uh, you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids###and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor --n40270f.###and that's just really not enough.###.###no.###it isn't.###.###and i was talking to somebody that --n402880 teaches in a middle school	###but, you know, part of my feeling is that if you solve, help them to work through their problems while they're littler, then they won't have as many problems up there.###.###true.
101155:91	###.###really.###.###we have always, though, had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids###and they divided them up between three counselors###but for a good while every year they'd have a different counselor###and they decided that didn't work.###.###yeah.###.	###.###uh-huh.### they they do that here.
101206:12	###.###right.###.###that's no good.###.###i'm on that, um, campus strategic planning committee for my school.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, one of the, uh, you know, oh,	###but, anyway, one of the key things was that that we believed that the public education is the best economic value.###then i think they decided --n404299 to strike economic.###.
101206:35	###.###right.###.###that's no good.###.###i'm on that, um, campus strategic planning committee for my school.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, one of the, uh, you know, oh,	###but, anyway, one of the key things was that that we believed that the public education is the best economic value.###then i think they decided --n404299 to strike economic.###.
101333:49	###what an experience.###.###and, uh, the university...###.###.###okay.### do you, have you ever had --n400048 to put your children in, child care, mary dell.###.###oh yes.###i'm an old experienced hand.	###.###.###my daughter that --n4002ba's seventeen now i worked even when she was a baby --n4002ed.
101355:31	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and it was a wonderful environment.###.###.	###.###uh-huh.###i see.
101723:11	###and, then she's old enough --n406d29 to,###.###.###okay,###i guess we're going --n400044 to discuss food and cooking.###.###alright.###.###do you enjoy cooking.###.	###.###.###i'm kind of that way, too.
101749:37	###.###how big is the family you cook for --n40056a --n400571.###.###uh, five.###.###uh-huh.###we have four,### so, and two of them are teenage boys,###so.###.	###so,###.###are they..
101855:23	###and, uh, i don't know,###one of his favorite things is, uh,###well it's called --n401ba5 seafood stew###and it's really, it's really like a s-, soup that, that you serve --n401c5f over rice.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it.###and,###.	###.###no,###no.
102022:18	###.###uh-huh.###.###and that's it,###and some hard-boiled eggs.###.###yeah.###ooh, that sounds good.###.###and that's it.	###.###uh-huh.###.
102126:102	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.### and, and drink wise they have kool-aid, milk or water. normally.###.###yeah.###.	###.###.###that's when they, as our family would say, a pig out --n40663b.
102179:7	###.###yeah.###.###so we've really been talking about the foods, you know, for him to, to be sure --n4071c8 to eat --n4071d7###.###the lower cholesterol foods and stuff.###.###and, uh, so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days.###.###.	###well, i think we've probably talked long enough###and.###.
102205:13	###.###no,###that's unusual.###.###.### seems like usually,###.###i've had some from plano, too.###.###oh yeah.	###.###uh-huh.###okay
102340:21	###like you said, i mean, there's, they might be saving money,###i mean even if they had --n40324e to pay more now, i mean in the long run it --n403285's going --n403294 to cost society more to force two people to work. even though it's higher productivity is short-term.###.###that's right.###.###.### it's already, it already costs society much more because of it.###.###.###you know it,	###.###yeah.###.
102410:17	###.###a lot of it is,###and you can tell which kids --n40489b have been in day-care centers.### it, it's really obvious --n404947 to look at them and watch the way they act --n40497e and things. that, um, they've been raised --n4049b1 in a day-care center.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###that's pretty sad because, i mean, i don't know, something's got --n404ba6 to change with the schools.	###.###well, i think it's going --n404d90 to, change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else.###.
102421:34	###.###well, i think it's going --n404d90 to, change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else.###.###when they're young --n404ea0,###.###.###yeah.###.###the home is the base,###it's the basic unit.	###and if we don't start --n40505f making changes in the homes###and maybe part of that is educating parents better.###.
102488:42	###.###so, uh, i guess i guess actually on those, those times, uh, we even, there are times i even say, oh, please don't sit us next to a table with other children --n401074,###.###well,###.###.###this is our night out.### so but, uh, anyway, where do you like --n401306 to eat --n401315.###.###uh, well, uh, we don't have any children	###.###.###and, uh, we're very attracted --n40155a to exotic food.
102772:17	###it was really good.###we###.###oh.###.###uh, jeff wariner just got out of the hospital###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, jeff and deeanna --n4004e5 went and another friend in the neighborhood,	###we had both moms and, uh, fifteen year olds and a twelve year old###and everyone enjoyed it.###.
102783:11	###we had both moms and, uh, fifteen year olds and a twelve year old###and everyone enjoyed it.###.###oh, my goodness.###.###and, uh,###.###oh, well i am just dying --n40075d to see it.###i went to dinner with some friends last weekend###and they said get a baby-sitter	###.###yeah.###.
102809:13	###.###oh my.###well, let me see.###was it,###well, we went --n40105b to see one hundred and one dalmatians last weekend###and that may be,###no,###right before i went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on,###we're going to the movies.###and we won't,	###but i go maybe once every couple of months.###.###yeah.
102929:84	###and i'm just still real sore.###.###yeah.###.###and today i was, i, course i went back to work two weeks after, uh###.###oh, gosh.###.###but see i don't have permanent work.### i, right now i'm working with a temporary agency.	###.###oh.###.
102998:92	###.###and, uh, i'm holding out for city slickers for the two of us because, uh, we had friends that --n404f9c went --n404fa7 to see that and said, you know, it's just perfect for our age group###.###uh-huh.###.### and because i think he, he needs a comedy, too.###uh, and that --n4052a7's what he would have liked --n4052c6 to have seen --n4052d9 regarding henry, too,###but knew that, uh,### we've, we've got a lot of company this summer, which --n40544e is wonderful.###we're really enjoying it	###.###uh-huh.###.
103002:69	###.### and because i think he, he needs a comedy, too.###uh, and that --n4052a7's what he would have liked --n4052c6 to have seen --n4052d9 regarding henry, too,###but knew that, uh,### we've, we've got a lot of company this summer, which --n40544e is wonderful.###we're really enjoying it###but some of the different things we're doing --n4055a5, uh there's just not a time, enough time to do it all --n4055f0###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah.###.
103129:10	###.###yes.###uh,###.###oh, i love it.###.###before we moved to, the area, my brother, uh, lived in dallas for a number of years###.###.###and we came up one time when my father was visiting --n400e7d	###.###uh-huh.###.
103340:11	###.###i don't know if you tried### but or s-,###.###oh###.###.###i've heard of it.### where, where it's made,### it's like, it's like a,	###.###yes.###.
103551:22	###.###what --n401fa7's interesting, several years ago, i took a course, uh, on, uh,###well, it was actually, it was put --n4020c9 on by the power companies and, about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was --n402128, and there wasn't --n402143 from various kinds of, of energy.###and, uh, at that point in time, one person that --n40236d was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain###and it was kind of pooh-poohed --n402480, you know.###oh, you're making a mountain out of a molehill, kind of thing.###and it's turned out that, that's been very true, what he was forecasting --n402602 about the accumulation of, of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do --n402659 to foliage.###so, it's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when i took that course --n402833.###now, a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear.###uh, i'm not afraid of nuclear, --n40299d having had that course because of how the nuclear that, uh, they use --n4029e0 is not bomb quality --n4029f7,	###and, it doesn't pollute the air at all.###it --n402cde's safer --n402ced to be around a nuclear plant then it --n402d18 is to be around a coal plant.###many more deaths --n402e4c have occurred in --n402e5f and dealing with --n402e76 coal plants then ever around nuclear plants.

103586:20	###.###uh-huh.###but, uh, solar, of course, would be the clean, the cleanest.###.###well, i know it's mumblex, um,###.###.###we did have a solar water heater when we lived in houston --n403b4d###and, uh, oddly enough i thought our part of the country was ideal.###.	###.###oh. i don't know what to,###usually it's the other phone i have trouble with --n403ddc.

103628:17	###.###oh yeah.### it, it's still got a long way to go --n404716.###.###well i,###.###it's just, you know, a possible solution in the future, i think --n404844, maybe to help in some ways.###.###yes.###.	###maybe they'll come up with fusion. you know, con-, be able --n404a0e to control it.###i don't know how long that'll take --n404b2a,###but, one of these days,
103639:7	###maybe they'll come up with fusion. you know, con-, be able --n404a0e to control it.###i don't know how long that'll take --n404b2a,###but, one of these days,###because that's perfectly clean.###.###yes.###.###it's just we can't control it.###right now it --n404cf3 takes more energy --n404d06 to cause fusion to occur then you get out,###so, it isn't,	###and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field,###so that's not going --n404f3f to work.###at least not now.
104014:36	###.###i grew up next door to, uh, the richardson symphony orchestra leader###so,###.###oh, chris xeros.###.###yeah.###.###oh, you lucky thing.###.	###and, my parents still do.###.###yeah.
104041:8	###yeah.###.###oh, gosh.###.### sure did.###.###gosh,###small world, huh.###.###yeah.	### and, uh, and we're still in contact with each other.###.###oh.
104046:8	###.###gosh,###small world, huh.###.###yeah.###we all went to high school together### and, uh, and we're still in contact with each other.###.###oh.###.	###so,###.###oh gosh.
104338:30	###okay.###well, let's see,###well, we keep our paper, paper bags lined --n4000c1 up in the garage for glass and, glass and, uh, plastics###and, uh, we make the dump over to the wal-mart bins there as soon as they're full.###i guess we collect m-, milk cartons and whatever p-, other plastics --n40033a are acceptable.###.###are you in the part of town where, uh, they have gotten into the other containers --n400476 yet for recycling --n400489.###.###no,###no,	###.###well, maybe they don't.### i, i know that was supposed --n4006ab to be in may
104347:48	###no,###i didn't think that anybody had those at all yet.###.###well, maybe they don't.### i, i know that was supposed --n4006ab to be in may###and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was, was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were --n4007ea.###.###right.###well, no,###i haven't seen any,	###so i have no idea what they look like --n400b30###and, i'm kind of anxious --n400bbf to see them.###.
104366:241	###and i say, well, they work fine###and i keep mine outside the garage so that i don't have any odors###but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh,###.###oh, right.###.###it --n4010a1 will be interesting to see how well that works --n4010d0###and i am, i'm glad the community is doing it.###uh, it's one of those things that --n401265 kind of has --n401278 to be forced --n40128b on people.###uh, i don't know if, where you grew up --n40139d in your, what you saw --n4013bc back, uh, years ago,	###.###right.###.
104374:8	###uh, it's one of those things that --n401265 kind of has --n401278 to be forced --n40128b on people.###uh, i don't know if, where you grew up --n40139d in your, what you saw --n4013bc back, uh, years ago,###but for me the thing that --n401505 strikes me is i, uh, growing up in rural south dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them --n401598 is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say --n4015db we had the recycling going on then that we should have --n40160e now. which --n401621 was all the milk bottles were glass###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###and you got a nickel or dime, which in that time --n4019b2 was a lot of money, when you returned them --n4019e1.	###.###oh.###.
104402:29	###.###and so you just put the empty ones back out there###and he took them away and put, you know, put another gallon of glass, glass bottle in there.###.###yeah.###.###so, uh, yeah,###.###so, uh, you know, i look back at, at, uh, my childhood###and i'd say, you know, they were doing things --n4021bf then that we should be doing --n4021de now	###.###right,###right,
104402:116	###.###and so you just put the empty ones back out there###and he took them away and put, you know, put another gallon of glass, glass bottle in there.###.###yeah.###.###so, uh, yeah,###.###so, uh, you know, i look back at, at, uh, my childhood###and i'd say, you know, they were doing things --n4021bf then that we should be doing --n4021de now	###.###right,###right,
104482:12	### the carton. the paper carton.###.###.###right,###right,###so, i hadn't seen that in a long time.###.###yeah.###well, i mean the,###you really look and say a lot of the things we need --n404936 to do --n404945, we were doing --n40495c	### and, and, uh, uh, i'm not really say going back to good old days,###but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now --n404d9c.###.
104490:57	###well, i mean the,###you really look and say a lot of the things we need --n404936 to do --n404945, we were doing --n40495c###and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons, the wood, uh, racks which now, basically, you could turn --n404ac4 them into the plastic ones that --n404ae3 would hold, uh, twenty-four bottles.### and, and, uh, uh, i'm not really say going back to good old days,###but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now --n404d9c.###.###yeah,###yeah,###well,###.	###.###no,###he doesn't like the paper sacks
104522:17	###.###that's nice.###i guess they dump it the same place,###i wonder where they dump that --n405acd.###.###well, there's someplace, you know,###if it's,###because really, when i look at what my grass does --n405c1d in, in actually about twenty-four hours --n405c40, uh, --n405c53 knowing what the farmers do --n405c6e in rural areas,###they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it###and it naturally, uh, composts or stores	###and it will naturally decompose, uh,###so you just have --n40608c to kind of keep in separated###and then, uh, who --n406138 knows how they process it from there --n40615b and what they turn it into --n40617a,
104557:50	###but, uh, you know, the last movies that i've seen --n40027a were probably on video.###.###oh, well that's,###we rent a lot of videos too.###.###yeah.###.###uh, we saw,###i have two little babies###and we saw one movie recently	###.###uh-huh.###.
104569:7	###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###now i ha-, i haven't seen the terminator movie,### but, and that's kind of blood and guts, isn't it.###i don't particularly care for that sort of stuff.###.###well, i don't either.###it,	###he doesn't.###he maims them.###.
104609:13	###uh-huh.###.###and i was pretty disappointed in it.###.###oh.###.###now it's a good movie,###but, i guess that they built me up too much. for my expectations in it there.###.###yeah,	###.###.###uh-huh.
104670:33	###it j-,,###i guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to, uh, just at the house watching it with, with no one else around.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###so,###.	######and,###because i have a ten year old
104825:15	###.### must have left an impression.###.###.###-ing seems --n40001a to be a, a topic that --n40003d's going --n40004c to probably take about a generation --n40006b --n400072 to, uh, catch on, it seems --n4000a1, or maybe a generation to two.###and we may have --n400276 to do it out of necessity as far as --n4002a1 moving that time schedule up.###uh, it does seem --n400391 to be a lot of habits to break --n4003c0.###i, uh, wasn't raised --n4004a1 as a kid on it,###but my kids are --n400540###and so they, they tended --n400595 to want --n4005a4 to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do --n4005ef --n4005f6,	###and they weren't worth anything anymore.###.###uh-huh.
104839:19	###.###and we,###it took us, almost a year --n4008bc to get a garbage sack full.###we just don't drink that many.###so as far as at home use, uh, we'll pick up a six pack --n400a0c every once in a while or for whatever occasion of doctor pepper or something### and, and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in --n400b8f, uh,###at the time it was still, oh, about forty or fifty cents a pound,###and we came out with about a dollar,###it just really wasn't worth it.###.	###and cans laying,###.###yeah.
104854:8	###yeah.###.###so, they, they realized, you know,###well, of course to them --n400fb0 a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old.### that wasn't, uh, that was a big deal,###but we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it###and then, uh, t i started --n4011e6 keeping up with, uh, cans there,###so occasionally i'll bring whatever --n4012b3 i've got --n4012c6 laying around the car or the like and throw them in there.###least it gets back into the system,###but, as far as a habit at the house, uh, i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants --n4014af to pick --n4014be up.	###.###no,###i read in the paper this week where maybe,
104864:16	###have you all got the individual containers yet.###.###no,###i read in the paper this week where maybe,###i don't know if it w-, was,###i guess maybe this week someone may start --n4017bb getting them if the truck that --n4017da picks them up is outfitted --n4017f5 in time.###.###um.###.###but, it, it should be starting, i would stay probably in the next month if, if everything goes that,	###i really don't understand that part on what they've told you --n401c23 to separate everything --n401c36.###.###right.
104876:63	###.###right.###yeah,###it seemed like, uh,### if, if i recall, it's been a long time.###they're way behind schedule on that particular part of it.###they were fine on the green, big green containers###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###oh.###.
104911:26	###.###that's true.###.###i was brought --n402f7e up, uh, you know, long time ago, that they didn't even have cans.###they had bottles###and you'd return them to the the grocery store###.###right.###.###and you'd get our money back	###they don't seem --n40325f to still be doing that.###if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass,###but, i guess this day and age they don't.
104966:22	###uh, it --n4043b2 was just easier --n4043c5 to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat.###.###right,###yeah.###.###so that's the main reason we're, we, sort of are into cans --n404589 at this point rather than the liter bottles.###.###where do you take your cans --n4046c2.###.###well, as you say, it takes a while to build it up.	###oh, i think the kids, when we were on vacation --n4049a1, they said they did take them to a, a recycling place, probably at one of the li-,###.###.
104997:19	###.###and, uh, i read magazines mainly because they're fast and if i want --n400740 to relax while i watch t v,###of course, i'm one of those that --n400875 does two things at once,###and, uh, i read good housekeeping and better homes and mccall's.###and i like them because they're kind of short and to the subject.###.###right.### i u-, i used --n400ac6 to take mccall's and good housekeeping and, uh, several magazines like that a few years ago at, at, at home.###.###uh-huh.	###.###but, yeah,###the subscriptions ran out
105075:58	### i, i subscribe, like i said, to a few###and once in a while i buy that new magazine called first --n4021e4 on the newsstands or something like that.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i kind of stay with my own subject matter what, uh, --n402323 pertains to my daily life at the present time.###.###right.###.###.	###and i have --n402580 to read the magazines, you know, such as byte, and computer world and mac world and all of these,, uh, magazines such as that,###so i really, you know, just,###i can see that it will be a very long time, probably, before i subscribe to any magazines at home.
105076:68	###and once in a while i buy that new magazine called first --n4021e4 on the newsstands or something like that.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i kind of stay with my own subject matter what, uh, --n402323 pertains to my daily life at the present time.###.###right.###.###.###well, since i work with computers during my work, i have --n402457 to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything.	###so i really, you know, just,###i can see that it will be a very long time, probably, before i subscribe to any magazines at home.###.
105128:41	###.###uh-huh.###.###and i tried, uh, --n403552 reading the magazines --n403565 hoping i would get more from it###and it was just above my head without having someone --n403669 there --n403678 to give me the advice as i went along.###.###uh-huh.###.###it was, you know, kind of a little bit more than what i needed --n4037fa,###so i never did get into them.	###i think they all that-, thought, well, we have a live one.###she'll subscribe.###.
105129:17	###uh-huh.###.###and i tried, uh, --n403552 reading the magazines --n403565 hoping i would get more from it###and it was just above my head without having someone --n403669 there --n403678 to give me the advice as i went along.###.###uh-huh.###.###it was, you know, kind of a little bit more than what i needed --n4037fa,###so i never did get into them.### i, when i bought the computer --n403931, all of a sudden i was receiving them, for some unknown reason, through the mail.	###she'll subscribe.###.###uh-huh.
105220:53	###.###it --n402316's kind of hard to, to get an even keel on that.###i mean, it's really hard to say --n40243f,###well, there's, you know, a hundred thousand per year affected by this one###so let's give it this amount,###and then this other one's only a tenth of that,###so give it a tenth of that and, and just keep --n402700 doling it out that way###or,###.###well, i'm, i'm glad i'm not the one that --n40284b's, that --n402862's in charge of, of making those decisions.	###i mean it's not so serious, i guess --n402bbe, until it affects your family###and then all of a sudden it's the most important thing.###.
105220:69	###.###it --n402316's kind of hard to, to get an even keel on that.###i mean, it's really hard to say --n40243f,###well, there's, you know, a hundred thousand per year affected by this one###so let's give it this amount,###and then this other one's only a tenth of that,###so give it a tenth of that and, and just keep --n402700 doling it out that way###or,###.###well, i'm, i'm glad i'm not the one that --n40284b's, that --n402862's in charge of, of making those decisions.	###i mean it's not so serious, i guess --n402bbe, until it affects your family###and then all of a sudden it's the most important thing.###.

105264:16	###but that's,###.###right,### just change our priorities a little bit.###.###yeah.###.###.###you know, you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza###or you hear these, these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this, that or the other	###but are they that enhancing for the, for the masses, you know.###.###right.
105269:47	###yeah.###.###.###you know, you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza###or you hear these, these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this, that or the other###and then you have all the arts that, that --n404597 are nice and aesthetic,###but are they that enhancing for the, for the masses, you know.###.###right.###.	###but, uh, had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else,###.###.
105270:17	###.###.###you know, you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza###or you hear these, these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this, that or the other###and then you have all the arts that, that --n404597 are nice and aesthetic,###but are they that enhancing for the, for the masses, you know.###.###right.###.###they certainly do well for those who --n40475f go to the symphony orchestra and all that,	###.###.###okay.
105326:45	### i, i honestly feel if people have nothing to hide --n401669, they shouldn't have a problem with it.###.###right.###.###and if they are trying --n4017da to hide something, then i have --n4017fd to know that, because we're t-, we're talking major liabilities.###not only with themselves, but with other employees.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i really, you know,	###.###yeah.###.
105351:29	###uh-huh.###.###they feel that's not fair and whatever,###but, you know, those kind of things i'd like --n402693 to know --n4026a2 myself.###.###yes.###.###it wouldn't be,###in my opinion,### i, i've had a lot of dental work done --n40281c,	###so###.###oh, really.
105377:12	###.###that is, because, well,###and i worked for a dentist###and that's, uh, you know,### you, you come in contact with a lot of, of blood and things like that###and it's real, real dangerous.###.###uh-huh.###.### i, i would think,	###airlines just drive me crazy.###people are afraid --n4031f1 to fly now. you know, just because of, they don't know what their pilot's been doing --n403258 and, and things like that###.
105504:12	###that's true.###.###but, uh, i found the motor boating was real fun.###.###yeah,###i remember --n4024ba learning how to ski --n4024d5, oh,###i guess i was seven or eight years old###and the lake that we learned on --n40260a was the smaller of the two that we had access to --n40263d###and it was maybe fifteen, twenty acres###and it was, uh, it had a lot of, uh, turtles in it.	###and i was down in the water and, and set --n402914 to go### and, uh, and just as that boat took off, a turtle bit me in the middle of the back.###.
105529:43	###.###and so i get back down in there### and, and i'll be if he didn't do it again.###this time a little earlier### and, and i had let go before then and, before they took off this time and, and swatted him away.###so i moved over a, a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living --n403339 underneath the dock and, uh, managed --n403360 to get up.### didn't go very far,###but i got up.###and it, it was a nice, uh, nice long skiing career,###but now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me --n40368c.	###you know, skiing on one and jumping around here and there###and i, i, i know how you can get injured --n4039a3 --n4039aa doing much more than that --n4039c5###and i just can't risk it right now --n403af2 being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that.
105532:60	###this time a little earlier### and, and i had let go before then and, before they took off this time and, and swatted him away.###so i moved over a, a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living --n403339 underneath the dock and, uh, managed --n403360 to get up.### didn't go very far,###but i got up.###and it, it was a nice, uh, nice long skiing career,###but now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me --n40368c.### i've, i've, uh, done about all i dare --n4037b0 do --n4037bb on skis.###you know, skiing on one and jumping around here and there###and i, i, i know how you can get injured --n4039a3 --n4039aa doing much more than that --n4039c5	### just, uh, can't take the risk i did --n403c18 as a dumb teenager, i guess --n403c3f.###so life just changes a little bit in that respect.###i'd kind of like, someday, --n403db9 to maybe end up on a pair of skis that, that --n403df0 doesn't have a, uh, well, what they call --n403e2b trick skis.
105663:16	###.###no,###i know this is a real good time to go --n401dfb, because they are having so many activities and special shows.###.###well, and with a daughter, nine, it is just,###she's old enough to really grasp the meaning behind,###.###yes.###.###.	###.###uh, so, well, if you're working, then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go --n402163.###.
105695:24	###and, uh, it has just worked out really well with this, uh, position he's in --n4027fc. because i can go at a spur of the moment or what have --n40283b you###.###uh-huh.###.###and it --n4029b8 depends where he's going --n4029d3 whether or not i decide --n4029ee to go along###.###sure.###.###but i do, do like --n402aed to travel###and it's, uh,	###.###uh-huh.###.
105737:26	###and so i've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets###because we have a lot of flying with continental###.###uh-huh.###.###and they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of continental.###.###right,###it's kind of shaky.###.	###.###that's true.###.
105794:113	###.###.###uh, i work at t i###and we have, uh, of course, started drug testing, uh, random drug testing here###and, uh, i haven't gotten called --n40017f yet,###but, uh, i feel that it's probably pre-, it's pretty good if, if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs.###.###do they feel that way.###.###uh, i think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at t i,	###.###uh-huh.###.
105877:114	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.### and, and it would be, uh, you know, out of the question.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###that's right.###.
105900:37	###.###so,###.###.###right.###.###and i think it --n40255a's good that they're trying --n402579 to start some programs down in the elementary schools.###.###right.###.	###and if they need --n4027d6 to do that as a condition for employment###.###uh-huh.
105959:17	###it's not like a normal urinalysis###.###uh-huh.###.###it --n40353d's very expensive to run them.###and, uh, i didn't get a raise this year,###because, nobody in our company got a raise.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###just lucky to have jobs.###.
105963:21	###it --n40353d's very expensive to run them.###and, uh, i didn't get a raise this year,###because, nobody in our company got a raise.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, yet they spend all the money on drug testing###.###just lucky to have jobs.###.	###so, see, there, you know, there's different,### i don't think that that's, that, i think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a, a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem###.
106011:41	###i don't know, you know,###that's just guessing it.###maybe they run a lot of other tests,###or maybe it's under a health type program that --n404736 it it, it would catch a lot of things.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###but, no###for all the, the pub-,
106109:15	###we've transferred around,###and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake, uh, on lake erie.###so the lake life appealed to me,###and my husband's working###and he left it up to me if i worked or not.###.###wow.###.###so, in my spare time, i love --n4015db to sew.###there aren't too many people around --n40166d anymore that --n40167c really enjoy sewing,	###and we recently purchased a new home,###so i enjoy --n4017ea doing my, uh, toppers for my window applications and things like that.###.
106130:15	###.###that is excellent.###.###what part of ohio are you in --n401bd9.###.### we're in the sub-, i'm in the suburb of cleveland###and i'm about, uh, fifteen miles, probably, from downtown cleveland, something like that.###and cleveland is located --n401e07 right on lake erie###and prior to this, we were fifty miles west from here.###so we were right on the lake.	###.###oh, what's that --n40203b,###.
106198:12	###.###.###all right, this is easy for me since i,###.###and me too, because i eat out a lot.###.###yeah,###well i travel,###i do about forty percent of my time is on the road.###.	###.###i eat a lot of meals out,###well i'm also married
106255:3	###but it is fab-, fantastic.###uh, there's a restaurant, and i don't recall the name of it, uh, in, uh, panama city.###of course, not too many people want --n4018e1 to rush back to panama city, uh, panama, the country, uh, panama.###.###oh, okay,###because i was thinking,###well, i, i grew up in panama city.###.###no### this is the country this is the country panama,	###.###i get it.###.
106347:25	###oh, really.###oh i've had,###.###magic time machine is the place you're thinking of --n403438,###.###that's it,###that's it.###i've had excellent food there.###.###see, i, when i went --n4035a9, i thought,	###.###true.###.
106358:3	###.###true.###.###.###true.###.###but then i just thought the food was over priced for what it was --n403735.###.###uh-huh.###yeah,	###well, that's great.###uh, no,###italian is fine.
106526:19	###.###she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day.###.###right,###and that becomes difficult then.###.###so.###.###.###she was falling down and hemorrhaging	###so it just became too much for me to handle --n1208f,###even though i would have liked --n12133 to have had her stay, with her health being what it was --n1216e she couldn't anymore.###.
106632:34	###.###they're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little girl for christmas,###and so i decided --n400909 to paint them,###and that wasn't as easy as painting the apartment.###.###oh, well, what kind of paint did you use --n400a39 for the, um, bookends.###.###well, it's, uh, it, that's half the problem right there is that it wasn't, it was a oil base,###so i had --n400cbe to get,###and when i painted them --n400d2e, i didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house.	###at first i didn't realize, you know,###i had never painted anything,###so i didn't realize that i needed that.
106645:19	###so i didn't realize that i needed that.###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, i kind of knew, in the back of my mind,###.###so you can't use oil on wood.###.###well, no,###you can use it on wood,	###and i went --n4012ec to wash the brushes out, and, uh, wash my hands,###and you can't wash it off with water.###you have --n401439 to get the, uh, a solution
106651:39	###so you can't use oil on wood.###.###well, no,###you can use it on wood,###but i just had it all over my hands,###and i went --n4012ec to wash the brushes out, and, uh, wash my hands,###and you can't wash it off with water.###you have --n401439 to get the, uh, a solution###and,###.	###.###yeah,###i had --n40161e to drive to the store
106658:39	###you have --n401439 to get the, uh, a solution###and,###.###oh, so you had --n401516 to go around with paint all over you, temporarily, anyway.###.###yeah,###i had --n40161e to drive to the store###.###.###yeah,	###.###oh,.###.
106675:24	###.###oh, is, is that what you usually use --n401b94 in the house, is latex.###.###yeah,### and, and it, it just like###.###um.###.###the same with the toys,###it --n401da0's just important to look for one that --n401dcb doesn't have lead in it, you know,	###.###uh-huh,###yeah,
106682:120	###.###the same with the toys,###it --n401da0's just important to look for one that --n401dcb doesn't have lead in it, you know,###it says safe for children, and all that.###.###uh-huh,###yeah,###i heard about that.###i guess a friend of mine had a, uh, well,### she, she just started up a day care center,	###.###yeah.###.
106706:79	###uh-huh.###.###and, um, what i had --n4026c6 to do --n4026d5 is just --n4026e4 coat this bare wood with a sealer,###and, uh, i had this big five gallon jug,###and it was like paint thinner.###i mean i, you know, it looked just like, it was the viscosity of paint thinner###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, you just took a roller and put it on there,	###so.###.###wow.
106713:11	###yeah.###.###but, uh, you just took a roller and put it on there,###and, uh, if you saw that the wood was getting wet, you know, that was, that was all you needed --n402afb.###so.###.###wow.###.###yeah,###it was,	###i guess it was about three hundred yards worth.###so. well, i guess it worked out.###it was pretty easy, actually.
106803:25	###.###well, it wasn't,###if it was my own i would have,###but my friend said, oh just go ahead,###you just go ahead,###it's easy.###.###.###i said, okay, it's your place,###.	###.###well, a couple of week ends###we would go down two or three hours on the weekends,
106812:21	###.###well, how long did it take you all --n4046b2.###.###well, a couple of week ends###we would go down two or three hours on the weekends,###.###uh-huh.###.###and,###.	###.###no,### there was, they were doing all sorts of repairs,
106815:33	###well, a couple of week ends###we would go down two or three hours on the weekends,###.###uh-huh.###.###and,###.###so there was two of you all.###.###no,	###and there was, i was just painting because i don't know how to do anything else --n4049c1.###.###well, that's easy enough.
106942:29	###and it went under,###and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment,###and now it just seems just such a large amount of money to spend --n402463 that, that we do have a used car,###well, he has a company car also,###but for our personal car we have a used car.###um, do you think that it --n402690's wiser to buy used.###.###we do for us###very much so.###in fact, we are in a position that most of our friends why, wonder why we just don't go to a new car, you know, whatever --n402840 --n402847,	###.###right.###.
106981:46	###that's right.###.###i said, well, we had one,###and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it###.###wow.###.###and it's an eighty-five,###and so i said, hey, this was a cinch,###we paid for the car,	###.###right.###.
106985:14	###.###wow.###.###and it's an eighty-five,###and so i said, hey, this was a cinch,###we paid for the car,###and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on --n403492.###.###right.###.	###and we intend --n403662 to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years, or next year probably.###.###do you, um, buy from dealers or from individuals.
107000:71	###generally from dealers,###and uh, it depends, because i don't like --n40387d to sell what we're trading --n40389c in to an individual uh, unless we, we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted --n4038ff to sell --n40390e --n403915###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###you know, we were going up to a larger one,###but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer, and we always make a deal.	###you're going --n403eee to get one shot at us###.###yeah.
107017:8	###i s-,###no,###.###.###this is the price we're going --n4040ff to give you --n404112 out the door.###we don't want --n4041e4 to hear about taxes,###.###.###okay.###i'll let you start.	###and how do you hold to yours --n4000f1..###.###no,
107059:62	###and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope, what she's buying --n400e64.###.###uh-huh.###.###and then at the end of the, of the period, pay period, if she has any left --n400fc0, that much is for fun or entertainment.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they kind of work it that way.###we tried for a while	###.###yes.###.
107101:33	###.###but do you sort of self budget even,###i mean, you wouldn't like on payday think, boy, i can go --n401c9d do this and that and this and that.###you kind of think this is got --n401db0 to str-,###.###no.###.###you kind of divide it in fourths in a way, don't you.###.###no.	###.###right.###.
107109:10	###.###no.###because if you charge things, uh, you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month, when you get paid --n401f87 --n401f8e,###.###right.###.###or you get paid --n4020aa the last day or next to the last day.###.###right.###.	###and there isn't anything left to spend --n4021d5 anyway.###.###well, that's true.
107131:41	###well, yeah,### we, we tried --n402633 to, to, to,###.###oh.###.###or we are paying them off now.###.###yeah,###we're not there yet.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
107192:61	###uh-huh.###but to, to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes i'll spend less on groceries but we'll go out.###so it --n403c2b's kind of hard to say this is how much you're going --n403c6e to spend --n403c7d --n403c84 going out for fun.###this is how much you're going --n403ddb to spend --n403dea.###it's kind of hard.###.###well, we, we eat out a good deal at this point.###.###do you.###.	###.###yeah,###yeah.
107325:20	###.###.###yeah.###.###.###we've progressed a little bit farther than that.###.###yeah.###.###um, actually they have, uh, parts of town,	###and, um, they will have these green bins###.###uh-huh.
107335:52	###it may have even spread all over the whole town,###and, um, they will have these green bins###.###uh-huh.###.###and it's just as standard as a, a regular trash can that they come by and pick --n4006ad up and dump --n4006c0.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, just along with a trash can you have this, this green plastic bin,	###aluminum.###you know, anything that --n400a22 can be recycled --n400a35 you just put --n400a48 in that bin.###.
107409:28	###see we don't have anything here in belton.### it's, it's a pretty small little town.###.###yeah,###i remember my grandparents and i used --n401d01 to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh,###.	###uh, they're, uh, getting a little bit more on,###they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it --n402051 mean --n40205c to recycle, and what can you recycle --n402087 and what you can't --n4020a6. because, you know, not a lot of people do really know what, you know, what it's for --n402109.###.
107441:73	###it may be --n402a54.###but, uh, they just go around to each, uh, door and pick it up.###.###wow, that's excellent.###.###yeah.###.###that's good.###.### let's see.	###.###yeah.###.
107484:27	###i'm hoping it will soon.###.###uh-huh.###well, the thing about newspapers and paper,###recycled paper is actually very expensive.###.###yeah.###.###so, when you see something that --n40363b's on recycled paper --n403652, they've actually gone to a lot of expense --n403681 to do that.###it's, uh,	### it's, uh, it's really a cost.###.###huh. i wasn't totally aware of that.
107522:20	###i can't either. because we're, we're at a very, you know, beginning stages,###.###okay.###.###so.###.###uh-huh.###.###we look forward to it to get better mumblex.###.	###.###yeah,###me too.
107554:62	###oh, gee.###.###and there would be like thirty people.###so people talk about, you know, big family reunions###and i think, like###i have a friend who --n1040a just went to, like, wyoming to some big ranch, you know, where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion --n10479.###.###oh, my.###.###and i,	###.###uh-huh.###.
107573:8	###and we always wer-, we always got together, just always.###now it's different because i live here###and i,###you know, when i go home --n10afe i try --n10b0d to see the families, as much of the family as i can###but it's real different.###.###yes.###.###and i grew up in a real not, i think --n10ce9 not normal setting.###.	###.###right.###i mean sunday dinner was at my grandmother's
107594:12	###.###well, i come from a very small family.###and we planned a family reunion --n1115b this spring. uh, where###we are from texas###and my family is from ohio###and we met in florida.###.###uh-huh.###.###so the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to disney together.	###so planning our family reunio-, reunion was very easy, you know.###.###yeah,
107674:70	###.###but i don't like, i don't like it --n4010de dirty.###.###no.### i have --n4011a8 to, you know i have --n4011c7 to say that's not exactly my favorite thing either really.###.###no,###i don't know.### we got the, we got the question###and i thought, oh, this is going --n401412 to be interesting.	###.###.###but although i do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work.
107677:42	###no.### i have --n4011a8 to, you know i have --n4011c7 to say that's not exactly my favorite thing either really.###.###no,###i don't know.### we got the, we got the question###and i thought, oh, this is going --n401412 to be interesting.###two bits i'll get a man --n4014c7 to talk to me, because they get stuck --n4014f2 doing it all.###.###.	###and this year we put in a new lawn in a new home###so, um, we've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall.###.
107714:17	###and from ohio since we're right near lake erie###this is going --n401e1b to be a switch for us for a week going down there,###.###yeah.###.###and i think we'll probably experience some of your weather although i think they have more humidity.###but, um, as far as the gardening and things like that goes i don't know, uh, too much, too much about, uh, how much i really r-, do enjoy it myself --n4020e9.###.###yeah.###.	###.### i, well, not here.###i mean it's just,
107821:15	###well, that's a thought.###.###well, can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do --n400bd7 to these people.###.###huh.###i don't know### i, i like that idea.###um, oh, i had a thought just a second ago###but it slipped my mind.###.	###.###um, one thing that i-, that i think probably one of the reasons that people don't vote more --n400ef0 is because they don't know the candidates.###and i think sometimes, you know,
107876:16	###.###of course,### what do you think and this is not one of our questions but what do you think --n40245e of this no excuse absentee balloting.###.###no excuse.###uh, i'm not sure if i'm familiar with that, or not.###.###okay.###.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
107908:15	###but this idea of anyone wel-,### i ju-, i am so bitterly opposed to this.###if you're busy, that has always been a legitimate excuse.###if you are incapacitated, ill health,###.###uh-huh.###.###but to have the expense of,### let's see.###they have five, six people at my polling place.	###and i don't know why we couldn't have duplicate voting on some of this --n40344e.###.###well, hopefully once they have, uh, you know, once they've checked them off the list they, they do have --n40356f to check them off a list when they vote --n40359a
107959:20	###.###it's rea-,###.###his grandmother too###and they're, that hi-,###her son, his uncle, whatever, you know, anyway.###.###.### he, he has, he's recently retired###and so he's the one who she moved in with --n400faf when she had a stroke --n400fca	###.###uh-huh.###.
107963:9	###and they're, that hi-,###her son, his uncle, whatever, you know, anyway.###.###.### he, he has, he's recently retired###and so he's the one who she moved in with --n400faf when she had a stroke --n400fca### and, and all the other children are working or whatever.###.###uh-huh.###.	### and, uh, so he's got, you know,###his retirement though is really twenty-four hours a day.###they have a day care two days a week.
108048:60	###yeah,###and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever --n402fb9, i don't know what they're going --n402fe4 to do --n402ff3.###it's really not my family.###it's my fiancee's###so i don't, i can't say much.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i always feel like i would never put my parents in either###and i wonder, i'm going --n403301 to be the only sibling that --n403320 isn't going --n403333 to have children	###.###really.###.
108103:36	### really isn't that much for elderly people to live on --n404744.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, even if they're in good health it's incredible.###.###right.###.###they don't have any,###they don't get special treatment	###.###uh-huh.###.
108168:42	###i miss that,###yeah.###.###so, that,###as soon as we got out of the cloud cover.###of course it wasn't sunny like it is here.###it was real gray###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah.###.
108295:140	###.###so, you, you reached me at my job.###.###oh, wonderful,###well how do you dress for work --n400308.###.### my, my dress for work, uh, most of the time is, uh, rather comfortable and casual uh, usually, uh, slacks and a soft colored shirt.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
108312:12	###.###.###so you're in a church there.###.###yes.###.###uh-huh.###well, i'm working, this is my first morning to work down at our little church preschool --n400a5e,###and they've told me --n400b46 to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds,###and they have a lot of, uh, they have bible lessons	###but they still have snack time and play time,###so, i'm going --n400de4 to be dressing just in casual slacks and t-shirts, probably not blue jeans, but little bit short of that, just, just tennis shoes and play clothes.###.
108370:51	###now yesterday i had --n401f0e to dress up, and and, uh, be more formal because i had a, a formal meeting at noon time,###.###uh-huh.###.###but then i can go home later in the day and, and be a little more casual###.###well that's wonderful.###.###and then if i have a, a meeting of people that i know --n40223c, i can be very casual in the evening.###.	###so he has --n402468 to dress,###and he just really hates it,###they have the long sleeve shirts and the whole tie and the whole suit,
108374:44	###but then i can go home later in the day and, and be a little more casual###.###well that's wonderful.###.###and then if i have a, a meeting of people that i know --n40223c, i can be very casual in the evening.###.###well, my husband has --n402381 to take the bus into dallas, and doesn't return all day,###so he has --n402468 to dress,###and he just really hates it,###they have the long sleeve shirts and the whole tie and the whole suit,	###.###yeah,### that's, around here in a lot of places that's the way it is --n402832
108435:6	###.###yeah,### what kind, what kind of shoes do they wear --n403a6f down there.###.###well, we wear,###of course, like i said, if my husband's going downtown, he's got the whole, uh, you know, the dress men's dress shoes###.###uh-huh.###.###but for as out here, just anything that the moms,	###.### we, we can wear pretty much that, although, um, tennis shoes are kind of out in, in almost every, every situation unless you want --n403ff2 to look like a gook.###.
108454:11	###i'm sure they are.###.###.###that's right,###i'm sure that true.###it's a lot different than working in a kids preschool.###.###a lot different.###.###that's right.	###.###you too,###and thank you for --n404502 calling.
108534:35	###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###.###.###right,###right.###.###and, uh, that's one of the reasons,	###.###uh-huh,###yeah,
108606:49	###.###so do you, do you have a favorite for the series or anything.###.###uh, probably the pirates,###but only because of steve bushel, i guess###.###oh, uh-huh.###.###otherwise i really don't care that much,###but, uh, you know, i'm, i'm annoyed that the rangers got rid --n402d66 of him,	###.###yes.###.
108633:62	###uh-huh,###yeah,###i live in garland,###and, yeah,### i, i like steve bushel,###but i don't really like the pirates.###i'm a big saint louis cardinals fan###.###uh-huh.###.	### they, you know, they they've come from so far down,###.###uh-huh.
108780:20	###.###some of it is kind of pointless,###.###right,### the monotonous the monotonous,###.###yeah.###.###no###that's not,	###.###uh-huh.###.
108807:37	###.###i guess i don't really care --n401c03 to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, i'm, with you though,###i like classical###.###uh-huh.###.	###i like easy listening, just kind of, you know,###i guess i don't care much for rock and roll any more.###i used --n4020d3 to like it all right,
108810:23	###uh-huh.###.###um, i'm, with you though,###i like classical###.###uh-huh.###.###um, i don't like --n401e5b to listen to it all the time, but, um, some of the time, anyway.###i like easy listening, just kind of, you know,###i guess i don't care much for rock and roll any more.	###but i don't really care --n402161 to listen to it any more for some reason.###um, let's see.###country western, uh, i'm not quite as big on that.
108942:37	###because it has almost everything in it.###but on the other hand, it's not very inspiring, uh,###it's a good reference when you need --n401440 to dig something up --n401457.###.###uh-huh.###.###what we've found --n40151f very useful is a book called the thirty minute cookbook, i think that's the title, by marion burroughs###.###huh.###.	##, you know, the whole meal###.###yeah
108952:60	###uh, which --n4016ad has recipes which --n4016c0 allegedly can all be prepared --n4016db in thirty minutes##, you know, the whole meal###.###yeah###.###and so she's###.###that would be wonderful in these times.###.###yeah,	###.###yeah,###either they're really fast
109003:127	###speakeranan*t49-1.###speakera49-2*t49-2.###yeah,###speakerbnan*t49-2.###.###that thirty minute cookbook.###.###thirty minute cookbook.###that sounds fun.###.	###.###uh-huh.###and i have young children,
109061:17	###speakera65-2*t65-2.###uh-huh,###speakerbnan*t65-2.###.###that's good.###.###uh-huh.###basically you're baking, baking chicken in a, in an open pan, um, --n4036a2 having marinated it first###and, my wife did this part###.	###.###speakera70-1*t70-1.###uh-huh.
109511:135	###.###uh, you know, to,### i, i don't think, you know, the kids don't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars, and, and, and this type of thing.###i think that they would from the, you know, attention or whatever###.###that's true.###.###uh, but, it,### i, uh, i, i don't know,### i, i see it as a major problem	###.###yeah,###well, you know, i, as i said, i teach school
109611:36	###and she's going --n403fde to work,###and she's going --n40404f to buy her house,###and she's going --n4040d4 to get her car,###and then she's going --n40415d to have her children,###and then when, you know, they go on one salary --n40420b, will they be able --n404226 to sustain what their life-style is --n404245.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they're back to work,###and, you know, i agree with you,	###.###yeah.###.
109656:33	###yeah,###i think that's a good excuse.###you need --n400b45 to get into the the system a little more and know where to take things --n400b8c.###.###right.###.###.###yeah.###.###we've been here probably two and a half years,	###.###uh-huh.###.
109746:24	###they fill up the whole kitchen garbage can###.###right.###.###so, i'll be glad when the bins do come --n402570,###and i think that's when i'll, i'll start --n402624 doing the plastic, too --n40263f.###.###yeah,###it was real easy with the bins,###it really was,	###so, um,###.###yeah.
109831:11	###.###right,###right,###i won't have any excuse then,###that's for sure.###.###all right, well, it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting, trying###.###thinking about it, anyway.###.	###.###yeah,###but, well, um, have you,
109847:15	###.###do they time this thing for us,###or do we,###.###um, yeah,###you can do it as long as you want.###they, you know,###if it's been long enough,###five minutes is, is when they cut in and say, say, we don't have any more room for recording --n404448.###.	###.###so we can say good-bye now.###.
109950:6	###.###yeah.###.###it has less than a thousand square feet###.###oh, wow.###.###yeah,###it's real little.###.	###.###yeah,###and now i have a daughter,
109958:63	###it's real little.###.###you all are cramped.###.###yeah,###and now i have a daughter,###now my, the one that --n10ea6 was five months old is seven years old###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
109988:30	###oh.###.###so, um, the people that --n1146d lived here before us did use it for a bedroom###.###uh-huh.###.###but we have always just put like our computer and extra toys and books and###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###.###but it --n116bf sure is nice to have it when the kids come over --n116f6 to play --n11705
109995:8	###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, it's kind of a catch all room.###.###.###but it --n116bf sure is nice to have it when the kids come over --n116f6 to play --n11705###.###yeah.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
110108:11	###.###.###well, what --n12d2b are the colors in your house.###.###uh, um, kind of a mauve and gray.###.###oh, i bet that's pretty.###.###uh-huh,###and then the kitchen's kind of a, a country pink and country blue,	###.###uh-huh.###.
110307:83	###.###are you,###.###you know, i think it's kind of coming back around to that, don't you,###i mean, that there's a lot more people --n400ce4 that --n400cef stay home now than before,###but i guess more than anything i think maybe people were just kind of wanting --n400e0f to have the choice of what they could do --n400e3a, you know###.###yeah.###.###i don't know,	###and you can't have everything###.###uh-huh.
110360:11	###or, if they wouldn't be able --n40294a to make ends meet not working or whatever,###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, i think it's got --n402a62 to be a personal choice,###and, it --n402b29's nice that, that we could have the choice to stay home.###.###yeah,###well i find that i, whenever i have --n402c7a to, whenever i'm in a group of people --n402cb1 and we're discussing things --n402ccc,###like just over the weekend i visited my family, and some cousins i hadn't seen --n402e85 in a long time,	###and, uh, you know, well, i had my baby with me,###and i found that all i talked about --n4030ed was my baby, which --n403108 was fine with me,###.

110966:23	###i said, who ever i talk to --n10f27 is going --n10f36 to be board, because when it's summer time --n10f65, i'm wearing shorts,###and when it's cold --n110bb, i'm wearing sweat pants, and most of, unless i'm going to something special that my daughter's doing --n1111e, or something like that,###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,### i, i like jeans a lot.###.###well, that's, that's good.	###and now nothing seems --n114d1 to be comfortable because i bulge in all the wrong places,###so.###.
110967:41	###and when it's cold --n110bb, i'm wearing sweat pants, and most of, unless i'm going to something special that my daughter's doing --n1111e, or something like that,###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,### i, i like jeans a lot.###.###well, that's, that's good.###i used --n113fd to wear jeans all the time until after i had kids,	###so.###.###oh, and it's, it's frustrating,
110993:21	###so it has --n119d8 to be not the straight up and down levis kind.###.###yeah,###yeah,###i know what you mean --n11abc.###well,###.### but, um, but i,###when i was, i was pregnant through the summer this time###	###.###oh.###.
111110:46	###.###yeah,###and then when you drive home --n13959, like especially if you're in a lot of traffic which you are --n13998 in dallas,###.###you burn up,###.###uh-huh###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah.###.
111194:38	###.###do you.###do you have children in the public school system.###.###yes,###and i taught for fourteen years before we moved to texas,###.###is that right.###.###and the, the one thing i see --n40052f is changing is i was held --n400552 accountable so much	###and instead of spending my time --n400753 coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms for all the children###.###you were a bookkeeper.
111195:68	###do you.###do you have children in the public school system.###.###yes,###and i taught for fourteen years before we moved to texas,###.###is that right.###.###and the, the one thing i see --n40052f is changing is i was held --n400552 accountable so much###i had --n400666 to document and create a paper chase for all of my students,	###.###you were a bookkeeper.###.

111298:12	###.###or just to face the children different directions or to do something###.###just,###yeah.###.###i know last year my son had --n402852 to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school###.###oh, goodness.###.	###.###oh.###.
111442:98	###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, but, uh, it seems like it's, i don't know if it's late.###i'm sort of waiting for indian summer###so i can get a lot of stuff down --n4011d0 out here.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i, i enjoy it.	###we came from nine years in a condo, uh,###and --n4015c5 working in that condo, you didn't have --n4015f0 to do anything you know, unless you really wanted --n40161f to,###.
111555:41	### that's, that's strange with me.###you know, you think, dallas, you know, almost semitropical, you wouldn't have that kind of, that kind of problem,###but,###.###well, for the most part we don't,###but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold.###well, the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter --n4035c8###.###uh-huh.###.	###we've noticed that crepe myrtles --n4037c6 don't do as well as they used --n4037ed to and, uh, pittosporum###.###really,
111561:48	###well, the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter --n4035c8###.###uh-huh.###.###but the, the ice storms really are stressful on all the, the plants that we have --n4036b8 around.###we've noticed that crepe myrtles --n4037c6 don't do as well as they used --n4037ed to and, uh, pittosporum###.###really,###oh do they.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
111588:9	###and i really enjoy --n403d18 getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens,###and texas is, d-, dallas is very nice.###i really enjoy it there. the landscaping, the homes, the architecture, the whole thing###very enjoyable gardens,###.###uh-huh.###.###and my wife and i,###.###except for the lack of trees, out where we are --n404009.	###.###well.###.
111610:109	### we moved, in seventy-six we moved to chicago,###we lived there for five years,###and i remember the first time i took my wife there on a house hunt --n404461,###uh, we were coming in###and before the plane landed she looked out the window###and she said, she said, mumblex there's no trees down there.###.###.###mumblex this is illinois,###you're not.	###.###um.###.
111617:10	###.###mumblex this is illinois,###you're not.###and, when we got out to the area where we decided we were going --n40477b to live and buy a house --n40479a --n4047a1, there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land###.###um.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and the first thing i did --n404a27 was planted all kinds of trees,###.###.
111618:37	###mumblex this is illinois,###you're not.###and, when we got out to the area where we decided we were going --n40477b to live and buy a house --n40479a --n4047a1, there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land###.###um.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and now all of a sudden it was being developed --n404994,	###.###.###do you have any.
111629:86	###.###.###do you have any.###.###sure.###i have a springer spaniel,###and her name is thumper.###she's about seven or eight years old.###i got her for christmas from my family, and, uh, back when we lived in nebraska --n4001b2.###i like --n400297 to hunt,	###.###did it work..###.
111864:56	###when we travel --n400ece we look for wendy's because we have kids,###and my husband and i like --n400fa5 getting the salads or the lighter meals###.###uh-huh.###.###and then that way they can get their burgers and fries###and we can have a salad bar###.###yeah.###.	###.###.###uh, yeah,
111908:25	###um.###.###or we eat junk food at home###.###yeah.###.###uh, now my husba-,###.###well, what are some of your, your favorite inexpensive places --n401d50.###.	###we sort of take turns.###and we, uh###i sort of favor the ones,
111992:36	###so, that's our nice place to go --n403320.###we don't usually take the kids when we go there --n4033cc,###.###but well, we don't go out that much,### i gue-, well, i guess we do go out without kids.###we're usually picking things up quickly,###though we just don't dwell on food too much,###.###yeah.###.	###.###right,###.
112005:30	###.###.###that's right.###.###so, it doesn't really matter to him.###he'd probably just like --n40391c to stay home.###.###yeah,###that's the way with my husband.###he's gone during the week and likes --n403a35 to eat at home on the weekends,	###.###.###so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend.
112011:19	###.###yeah,###that's the way with my husband.###he's gone during the week and likes --n403a35 to eat at home on the weekends,###and i've been --n403b05 eating at home all week long with the kids and would like --n403b3c to go out somewhere,###.###.###so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend.###.###well, i think, i, i never have liked --n403ce5 to cook food,	###.###right.###.
112024:90	###.###it was mainly baseball teams###.###yes.###.###and my husband would coach,###so we were never home at the same time.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###.
112058:54	###uh-huh.###.###that, uh,###those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment.###too often i feel that --n4006e2 people get off, uh, without,###.###.###yeah,### i, i agree with you, although i will say,###i'm not sure, you know,	###and the parents are saying, hey, wait a minute,###we didn't do anything like that you know,###.
112072:116	###uh-huh.###.### and, and, and i guess before i'd like --n400d78 to see that severe of a punishment for it it has --n400dab to be a, an absolute certainty you know, like, uh, caught at it, or something###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right,###right,###.	###.###yeah,###.
112092:36	###.###yeah,###well, sometimes they even wonder when, when, uh, criminals plead temporary insanity for, for punish-, for crimes that --n40153d are so severe and then, you know, they get sent --n401574 to a mental institution --n40158b###.###uh-huh.###.###and they play loony for a while,###and then they're back out in public.###.###well, but i can't see that either.	###.###yeah.###.
112134:61	###i guess, you know, a lot of,###and i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some miss america was abused --n4024c5 by the man she loved --n4024e4###and,###.###that's the new one.###.###is that the new,###i just happened --n402680 to see the headline on it,###and i didn't, couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what,###but i thought, uh, you know, if these things, if children are being abused --n402864, i, i'm wondering how our school system is failing --n40289b, that they're not even seeing this, you know,	###and that kind of, that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having, you know, --n402d51 to, to deal with that yet,###but still.###.
112134:111	###i guess, you know, a lot of,###and i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some miss america was abused --n4024c5 by the man she loved --n4024e4###and,###.###that's the new one.###.###is that the new,###i just happened --n402680 to see the headline on it,###and i didn't, couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what,###but i thought, uh, you know, if these things, if children are being abused --n402864, i, i'm wondering how our school system is failing --n40289b, that they're not even seeing this, you know,	###and that kind of, that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having, you know, --n402d51 to, to deal with that yet,###but still.###.
112162:10	###well, yes,### i, but i was from conservative wisconsin,###.###.###and, uh, you know, there was, there was, nothing on it, which --n4033a8 makes me wonder, you know, if it's as, uh, prevalent as, as some of them claim.###.###yeah.###.### it, uh, it, it, it's,###you just don't know,	###unless they're caught --n403788 in the act or the-, the-, the child is very badly, you know, beaten --n4037e3 up, it comes down to a one word against the other that type thing.###.###uh-huh,
112609:50	###i know.###the insurance.###.###but, uh, i, uh, fo-,###yeah,###for one thing.###uh, but yeah,### we, uh, we do###but our two had, had, uh, totally different interests of,###but the-, there was not much, uh, overlap as such.	###uh, he participated###band and, and, uh, scouts were his two big things.###.
112735:38	###well, i, you know, in terms of, in terms of any sorts of trends i, you know,### obv-, obviously things are different from, --n403286 for me --n403299 than, and my children than when i was growing up --n4032cc.###.###yeah.###.### i, i, i grew up on a farm, uh, in iowa,###and, uh, you know the whole family was around the, the whole time.###and then what my father did --n403639 was, was, uh, in-, you know, obvious to me###and i, i helped out with it.###but, uh, although i have brought my boys into --n403839 to see where i work --n403854, it's not that easy,	###and they, they just don't really have that same idea,###.###right.
112805:14	###right.###.###and hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home --n4048af.###.###.###very good.###uh, discussion or on child care.###.###do you have any children.###.	###.###oh.###.
112813:21	###do you have any children.###.###uh, they're all grown up.###.###oh.###.###.###i work in a day-care center###and mumblex.###.	###.###yes,###i enjoy it a lot.
112872:50	###yeah,###that makes it a little easier to deal with --n401198.###.###i've always thought, you know, it would be really tough.###what if you had a fire or something with babies.###.###oh, i know.###we,###.###you would have --n4013f9 to be able --n40140c to have enough,	###.###what we do --n4015ae is we have these cribs in the back room where they sleep --n4015e5 that --n4015f0 are, um, low to the ground###.
112888:68	###and they're reenforced --n401752 --n401759 real strong###and they'll sit four babies.###we would just lie them in there###and they roll real well and maneuver.###.###oh, well, that's, that's a,###.###that will get them out.###.###i hadn't thought about that.	###.###no.###.
112919:18	###uh, most everyone has a college degree in like early childhood education.###.###uh-huh.###.###and really there's only like eight children per room###and then there's like two or three, mostly three care givers in each room.###.###uh-huh.###.###and that enables them to spend more time with the children.	###so, it --n4023e4's nice to be able --n402403 to play with them and really get --n402426 to know them.###.###uh-huh.
112965:14	###so.###.###not quite.###it's a,###when they start --n402df4 to crawl --n402e03 they try --n402e12 to climb up on things###and###.###uh-huh.###.###you have --n402f11 to be real careful all the, everything is baby proof.	###but they try.###.###uh-huh.
112984:114	###in my area###because w-, i live in a college town in penn state university###.###uh-huh.###.###so i,###there is a lot of, a lot of college educated people and stuff that --n40336c are in the centers that --n403387 really seem --n403396 to have an idea of what --n4033b5's going on.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
113013:37	###that is sad.###.###and it's really bad, you know.###one of the girls she was leaving hers at where she felt like --n403dcd was a really good place,###and then they called her one afternoon and said, well, we thought we'd better call and tell you before you got over here.###lacy fell asleep on the bus after our field trip today,###and we just now found her.###.###what.###.	###.###oh, my god.###.
113045:52	###so she has switched to a different center now###and, uh,###.###well, i,###.###.###well, the types of vacations that i usually take --n40003a,###i usually come back --n4000d1 more tired --n4000e0 after my vacation, then i do, you know, before i take it.###.###.	###and i guess --n40039a to do that i'd probably have --n4003bd to take it at home.###.###oh.
113077:5	###and, uh, uh, the, the waves were huge.###i've never quite seen waves like this one###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, i was standing in water not more than, in barely above my ankles###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, you know when the waves go in the waves go out --n400be2 they kind of	###.###right.###.
113216:20	###.###yeah,###i just, uh,### that, that does absolutely nothing for me.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, i don't know###i can say that i think my, my favorite spots are still to go, --n4038da to go where there's mountains and, and a lot of trees and, and wildlife to view --n403945 --n40394c### and, and, uh, i like that kind of stuff.	###.###yes.###.
113226:58	###i could just sit there all day and look at the scenery.###.###yes.###.###.### i, i agree.### i can, i can do that too,###and, uh, you know, i think if i had, if i had the money, i would probably go to europe every year.###.###.	###.###.###uh-huh.
113233:11	###and, uh, you know, i think if i had, if i had the money, i would probably go to europe every year.###.###.###because, you know, i think that they have, they have it all over there in just a few tiny, two, two miles.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, there's mountains###and there's beaches	###so,###.###yeah.
113256:31	###oh.###.### so. so, but i, i would like if, you know it was anywhere in the world --n40473b to go, i guess, even though it's hot,###.###right.###.###i would like --n40491e to go to africa.###.###.###real excited when i heard this --n40002a.	###so football, i love this.###.###oh, yes.
113310:24	###and wasn't that fun.###i went to the balloon festival in plano and carried my little portable radio with me,###.###.###and i must say i attracted a lot of attention.###.###i bet.###.###people running up saying, oh, what's the score --n400f34, what's the score --n400f4f.###.	###.###that's right###and that's exactly what they said --n40117b,
113327:40	###.###you know, but i wasn't,###i had forgotten###or i probably wouldn't have been there.###.###yeah.###yeah,###well, i am, i'm a big football fan.###i never wou-,###my father was a football fan my whole life	###and i just hated it.###and i think i was just mad because he spent so much time --n40163e watching football on sundays.###.
113334:33	###well, i am, i'm a big football fan.###i never wou-,###my father was a football fan my whole life###and he used --n401503 to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff###and i just hated it.###and i think i was just mad because he spent so much time --n40163e watching football on sundays.###.###yeah.###.### and, uh, so when i met my husband --n401755, he was watching football	###i couldn't see him until like tuesday because monday night football, if i didn't, like football.###.###.
113458:10	###.###well, there is so much about it to like --n40403f.###.###it's exciting.###.###you know it's so exciting.###.###yeah.###.###and when the cowboys won the superbowl here --n4041b5, of course, they put together some real cute songs,	###and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item.###.###yeah.
113510:47	###you charge this for twenty, charge that for twenty, charge this for twenty,###and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars###and you don't stop --n400712 to think about it.###.###yeah.###.###i got in trouble --n4007ba when i was in the service --n4007d9 quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble.###.###oh, my goodness.###.	###now i carry one.###i have a gas card and a visa card.###and i never use them unless i need --n400aef to.
113531:9	###.###d-,###yeah,### i, i made a rule --n400c71 with myself when i got one --n400c90 that if i couldn't pay it in full every month that i'd have --n400cd3 to rip it up,###so.###.###yeah.###.###.###that's a good idea.	###.###that's,###.
113564:7	###and she do-, she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because she's going to school.###.###gee.###.### and, and so i mean that's just enough to pay rent and buy like thirty-five dollars worth of food a month. so and, and pay for her like, like monthly fee like twen-,### yo-, i guess you have --n401aae to pay like twenty dollars each month is the###.###yes,###something like that.###.	###.###yeah.###.
113621:22	###uh-huh.###.###and there's too many companies out there that --n402909 are willing --n402918 to give them to you and get you dra-, get you trapped --n402953.###i mean you can always file bankruptcy --n402aaf to get out of it,###but that's a lot of pain and hassle.### when, you know in the olden days when my parents were growing up and we couldn't afford everything --n402c2a, we didn't have such things as credit cards.###we just waited until time --n402da6 come around that we could afford it --n402dc9.###.###right.###.	###so. and i very seldom use a credit card on necessities.###i always use it for something i want --n402fc4 not something i need --n402fdf.###.
113750:5	###okay.###i've got a, you know,###i have a real good method of starting --n4000c8 to get the budget balancing --n4000e3###and then that's get half of the government, rid --n4001bc of the half of the government payroll.###.###i think that would probably, uh, be very possible,###.###.### and, and we really wouldn't feel it in our services.###.	### i, you know, i don't know if you've ever been to washington d c.###.###yes,
113757:38	###.### and, and we really wouldn't feel it in our services.###.###not all,### i, you know, i don't know if you've ever been to washington d c.###.###yes,###i have.###.###uh, you, you've seen that which --n4005b5 was on there and the offices	###.###right.###.
113766:22	###uh, you, you've seen that which --n4005b5 was on there and the offices###and in light of these, uh, hearings we've all been sitting through --n4006d1 the last two weeks, we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed.###.###right.###.###they really don't have enough to keep them busy to keep their noses at, in their own business of what they're doing --n4008c3.###.###right.###.###and the other thing is, uh, besides that i think, uh, two things that very definitely need looking at --n400a8c, one is foreign aid.	###.###right.###.
113789:119	###.###uh-huh.###.###and then the, uh, corporate, you know, industries just don't seem --n401515 to not pay proportionally.###.###right.###.###i think that that would, would help a lot.###i guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things,###but i don't know.	###.###uh-huh.###.
113821:11	###.###.###it's nev-, never helped my, my personal situation.### i i can't say it would help with theirs either.###.###no.###.###.###yeah,###and thank god we don't operate our budget, the way they operate theirs --n40263b	###.###.###amen.
113928:40	###.###i am very much for capital punishment.###.###well, wonderful.###i am too, one hundred percent.###.###my dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###all your life.###.
114053:49	###.###well, part of that is the overcrowding of the court system.###.###yea-,###that's true.###it is overcrowded because there's so much drug, uh, problem with the people on drugs###because that ha-,### they, with the drugs they're, they're robbing and killing###and, uh, that's why it's filled the prisons up so much --n402ef2 i think --n402f05.###.	###.###no,###it doesn't.
114064:8	###.###no,###it doesn't.###.###and, of course, your court system when you get into the appeals --n403118,###i don't believe criminal is in a court by itself.###and the whole judicial system is backed --n403270 up with a lot of junk that --n403293 shouldn't be in there.###.###yeah,###that's true.	###but,###.###we've gotten into a very litigious, uh, type of life.
114230:18	###.###uh, it's, it's really a gift to yourself### and, and that's, i think that's a really important lesson to learn --n403603.###.###yeah.###.### and, and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who --n40376f are not, uh, not really happy --n403796, you know.###.###well, that could be.###.	###.###yeah,###right.
114329:24	###because we have just, had a naturalization act where the mexicans that --n11439 were residents in texas, i'm from texas and have become citizens now --n11478.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###what do you think --n11608 about that.###.	###i, um,###at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing.###do you have an opinion about it.
114354:43	###no,###okay.###.###because texan philosophy is a little different.###.###right.###.###.###well, a lot of the experience that i have --n11bef with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who --n11c22's chinese and immigrated from china.###and, um, you know he, um, got a green card is, and is in good standing in america and china,	###.###uh-huh.###.
114471:16	###and the hose burst.###so i was stranded --n4005b9 out on the highway.###.###oh, no.###did you crack the block or what.###.###no,### i, i didn't do that###thank goodness,###but, uh, there seemed --n40078a to be enough antifreeze --n4007a1 in there, you know, left to do that	###so that was, that was a horrible experience just recently.###.###yeah,
114573:76	###.###yeah.###yeah,###i know### so but gosh, it's really starting --n401fa9 to, to wear###so i've been thinking, especially now is a good time to buy a car --n4020bd.###.###yeah.###.###go-,	###.###yeah,###i don't want --n40245a to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is
114629:40	###lot of snow and a lot of cold.###.###uh-huh.###well, especially don't you have what, a lot of salt on the ground.###.###yeah,###at times there's a lot of it.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah.###yeah,
114672:50	###yeah,###just because that way i know what --n4038f5's wrong with my car and what it needs --n403920 and what it really doesn't --n40393f.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###yeah.###plus if something goes wrong, i know who to blame --n403abe.###.###.	### my, uh, i had four brothers###and they used --n403cc7 to drag me out underneath the car, and stuff###so i can, i can do all that stuff
114675:34	###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###yeah.###plus if something goes wrong, i know who to blame --n403abe.###.###.###well, i, i think i'm getting too old for all that.### my, uh, i had four brothers###and they used --n403cc7 to drag me out underneath the car, and stuff	###but i, i think i'd much prefer --n403e45 to pay the twenty-two ninety-five --n403e60 to, to go --n403e77 have it done --n403e8a now###so i can get my hands dirty.###.
114841:57	###and, that, that way, those who --n401e25 want it can have it###and those who --n401efa don't want it, don't have --n401f21 to have it.###.###right.###.###sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself --n402039.###.###right,###you're,###.	###.###oh, is that right.###oh, that's interesting.
114956:26	###.###that's right.###.### but, but a dollar isn't it, you know,###it's,###.###oh.###.###uh, and i also sort of worry that, you know, that sometimes people giveaway personal information.###uh, when, when the call comes --n404541 and, and they, uh, you know, sort of seductive, to, you know,	###and so i start --n40477c answering###and then you, you know, you go down a path###.

115496:9	###.###.###uh-huh.###like, let's see,###and even like reading some new age things, things that i don't quite believe in --n402ae3,###like here on my shelf i have a book called journeys out of the body.###.###yeah,###i think that,###.	###.###i'm fascinated --n402dd8 by that.###.
115496:43	###.###.###uh-huh.###like, let's see,###and even like reading some new age things, things that i don't quite believe in --n402ae3,###like here on my shelf i have a book called journeys out of the body.###.###yeah,###i think that,###.	###.###i'm fascinated --n402dd8 by that.###.
115527:14	###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###right,###definitely.###uh,###.###and i like --n403267 to read, uh, i like --n40328a to read some self help books like, uh,###i read dianetics once, once	###.###uh, did you like it.###.

115605:48	###.###.###and, maybe now that that's over they'll, they'll come out of it###but,###.###well, that's an up and coming team, though.###.###yeah,###i hope they do something.###they need --n112fa to	###.###that's somebody you can get behind --n1144b and, be patient.###.
115633:43	###.###yeah,###uh-huh.###.###yeah.###they'll probably be pretty good.###course, the celtics are always really, really good, too, with their players.###.###that's true.###.	###.###that's true,###it will be interesting.
115772:8	###.###oh.###.###it's kind of, kind of neat.###.###yeah,### what, what does a computer club do --n4013ac.###i didn't know there were such things.###.###oh, yeah,	###they just get around and, and talk techy or, or else, uh, uh, you know,###like half the members are really expert###and the other half are like really not.
115960:17	###.###oh, really.###.###but, it's something i've always enjoyed --n400360.### do you, do you like boating.###.###yeah,###i love them.###.###yeah,	###and we were using it less and less and less,###so we decided --n400628 to sell it.###and,
116003:162	###guy just, you know,###he needs his weekends free, or --n400ddf --n400de6 to be able --n400df9 to use it or a day during the week or something,###.###yeah.###.### but, but, no###i guess for the cost of them you don't really,###it --n401059's hard to get,###i don't know,###i felt like i got my money's worth out of mine.	###.###uh-huh.###.
116148:12	###.###all right.###.###and, uh,###.###yeah,### it just, we just moved down here a couple years ago,###so,###.###did you.	###.###colorado springs.###.
116188:9	###yeah.###.###and it's kind of tough when my folks call --n403f97 and they want --n403faa to see them --n403fbd.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yes,###it's hard on the f-, your folks, too,###i know.	###and your wife's folks still live in colorado.###.###yeah.
116361:88	###i remember there was about four, five years ago.###.###yeah.###.###yes.###.###but, this, you know, this, uh,###i think --n4031c8 living in richardson, we're kind of spoiled because i think we get, we come closer to --n403227 getting our money's worth as far as the city is concerned, i think than probably any, any city in the country.###.###yes,	###.###is that incredible.###.
116370:63	###yes,###well, did you read in the dallas paper where they increased the teach-, the administrators' pay by thirty three percent after they laid off all those teachers --n403538.###.###is that incredible.###.###.### that's, that's the biggest mess i've ever heard of --n4036c0.###you know, how can you, how can you justify raising anybody's salary if you, you know, if you have --n4037f8 to lay people off --n40380f.###.###right.	###.###yeah.###.
116374:6	###.###.### that's, that's the biggest mess i've ever heard of --n4036c0.###you know, how can you, how can you justify raising anybody's salary if you, you know, if you have --n4037f8 to lay people off --n40380f.###.###right.###but, you know, i'm not going --n4039d8 to complain because plano got, we all got a pay raise this year.###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah.###.
116517:48	###wow.###.###.###around christmas time.###.###uh, no,###in march.###.###oh.###.	###.###wow.###.
116564:30	### i lo-, i know a lot of good places to go --n11fa5.###but you definitely need --n12083 to go to hawaii.###very definitely.###.###that's your favorite.###.###yes,###it is my favorite.###my husband hasn't been to europe yet###and i'd like --n12233 to take him there.	###and i haven't.###like, i haven't been down south.###i'd like --n1240f to go to new orleans.
116731:66	###i do like --n1405f to ski.###.### pretty, pretty down there.###huh.###.###yeah,### i, i said i do like --n1417d to ski.###.###so, where, have you skied --n14245.###.	###.###sure.###.
116799:18	###uh, six weeks.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah.###it was wonderful,###so you should think about --n151f5 doing something like that.###.###uh-huh,###i just had a friend that --n152b1 got back from europe	###.###.###jeri.
116849:13	###no,###mine are already in college now,###so i don't have --n400770 to,###.###yeah.###.###at least when they were in high school --n400805, it was beginning but not like the rampages.###.###well, i have,###my oldest is his first year in high school	###and it --n400a7f is really frightening, uh, to think that you can't even send them to school in safety.###i mean, certainly, you know, you can't just turn them loose in the middle of dallas,###but, you know, when you can't even, send them on their normal activities in safety --n400d15, it, it's really frightening.
116889:6	###.###maybe so.###.###you know, because i don't,###now i, somehow i feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen, you know, across the street, or seeing someone get mugged --n401e04, or unfortunately, raped --n401e1f,###and people don't do anything.###.###yeah.###.###a woman was raped --n402038 in richardson, i read in the paper oh, about a two weeks ago now --n402083.	###.###oh, no.###.
117146:81	###it's exciting,###we're winning,###so that's really exciting.###.###yeah,###well, i think,###i also, course, like --n402e94 to catch the news during the evening hours###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###.###so, usually i don't get a whole lot of news watching in.
117220:17	###uh-huh.###.###.###well, it sounds like ours are pretty similar.###i live in one,###i don't have a swimming pool.###and mine's about twenty-seven hundred square foot.###.###yeah.###.	###i think it's pretty much typical for this area.###.###it is.
117261:18	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###my husband got his big garage.### he ha-, we have a three car garage, that he has a big work area in --n400ebb###.###uh-huh.###.###and he likes --n400fae to rebuild cars and redo engines	###.###well, that sounds interesting.###i bet he's enjoyed --n40114c having it that way
117311:41	### my, we've just got a two car garage,###but my husband's got a big space in between the, where the cars are --n401d39 and the house, where he has a big work shop, you know, workbench and everything --n401d88.###.###well, sounds like our husbands have similar interests.###.###now, mine does not work on cars,###he just piddles on this and that.###.###oh, i see.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
117324:103	###.###.###well, that's nice that it's not in your house.###.###it really is.###.###uh-huh.###.###because, you know, they have a lot of things of their own,###and i, you know, i wouldn't mind --n4023bf having,	###.###uh-huh.###.
117324:126	###.###.###well, that's nice that it's not in your house.###.###it really is.###.###uh-huh.###.###because, you know, they have a lot of things of their own,###and i, you know, i wouldn't mind --n4023bf having,	###.###uh-huh.###.
117352:5	###and also the kids have friends who --n402c26 come and stay###.###uh-huh.###.###and so it seems like it's always used --n402ce0 as a bedroom.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###well, i still,	###but, i don't know,###i just still have need for the four bedrooms --n402eaf just having company from time to time. and some of them coming back home and things, you know.###.
117429:11	###i can understand.###.###it feels,###after they've been here ten minutes, they have already explored the entire house,###they know everything.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, they're fun.###.	###.###well, i just watch them.###.
117452:9	###i think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes.###at least my daughters have.###they try --n4045c4 to teach theirs --n4045d7 not to get into things instead of having to put everything up.###so it's worked pretty well.###there's,###i don't really think anything's been broken --n4047a0.###every now and then we have --n404835 to kind of go and say, now don't bother this, you know.###.###um, uh-huh.###.	###but, i guess most of the hou-,###d-,###what kind of roof does your house have --n404ac7.
117452:15	###i think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes.###at least my daughters have.###they try --n4045c4 to teach theirs --n4045d7 not to get into things instead of having to put everything up.###so it's worked pretty well.###there's,###i don't really think anything's been broken --n4047a0.###every now and then we have --n404835 to kind of go and say, now don't bother this, you know.###.###um, uh-huh.###.	###but, i guess most of the hou-,###d-,###what kind of roof does your house have --n404ac7.
117465:23	###what kind of roof does your house have --n404ac7.###here i'm getting off the subject.###.###well, we have,###.###.###we're supposed --n40001e to talk about crime in the city.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###well, uh, i,###that's,
117565:32	###and you figured it wouldn't happen to you.###.###sort of, yeah.###and i never did get a security system,###but since that happened, i certainly have.###.###yeah,###what kind of system do you have --n401e5b.###.###it's, uh, uh, i guess --n401ee5, excuse me, just a standard.	###.###uh-huh.###.
117571:93	###yeah,###what kind of system do you have --n401e5b.###.###it's, uh, uh, i guess --n401ee5, excuse me, just a standard.###uh,, with the, uh, all the doors and the, uh, infrared thing, you know, motion detector.###.###uh-huh.###.### pre-, pretty standard.###.	###.###.###yes,
117578:19	###.### pre-, pretty standard.###.### is, is this, is this one with some company that, that --n4021c6 services you and takes your calls and all that stuff.###.###.###yes,###yes.###.###.	###.###yeah.###.
117604:59	###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.### and, uh, but it, uh,###the monitoring is not that bad, though###because, uh, uh, we've goofed it up, you know,###several times you'll hit the wrong key, not intentionally or something### and, and they call back pretty quickly,	###but i,### to answer your question, i think, uh uh, i think, uh, that is a pretty good deterrent in itself,###.
117633:38	###who --n403351 knows, you know.###but that's a selling point.###and i think they're probably, i think it probably does these things or sur-, supposedly pretty good.###.###uh-huh.###.###boy, they sure advertise them, you know, so many of them nowadays.###.###sure.###.	###.###well, yeah,###uh,
117660:38	###i would gather probably from drugs.###.###absolutely.###.###and i think that's the reason it's so high everywhere --n403c3c.###.###yeah.###.###but, i don't think there's anyplace,### used --n403d92 to,	###but they do.###.###yeah.
117674:6	###.###we've had relatives that --n403f27 their children were just as involved in it, uh, as anyone, you know.###.### s-, s-, so, what's the solution --n40408d.###.###that's a good question.###i don't know,###i don't know what the solution is --n4041cb.###i really don't.###.	###.###yeah.###.
117818:101	###and, uh, --n401dc6 seeing as you've got some older children, i, i'm wondering, how did you handle that --n401e1d, when they were growing up --n401e3c.###.###yeah.###.###.###well, there, there was not nearly as much of it.###in fact, i, i think things were, were quite a bit different.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
118022:94	###and so, he said, well, puppies just chew when they're nervous --n40154d###and i, well, i wish you had told me you know,###.###oh, dear.###.###and it was about eight months later, he ate a piece of the linoleum --n401745.###he kept --n4017f4 picking at it###and i didn't kn-,### the, the tile in the kitchen###and picked a hole in it.	###and i told my husband --n401b97, i said --n401baa, you know, it's either me or the dog,###and he looked at me like, well, you know###.
118284:19	###actually, it's my son,###i know it is.###.###.###my older boy. he never likes --n405632 to come home from school.###anyway that's what we have --n4056e1,###and i have, i've tried --n405762 to start a fish tank###.###how does,###.	###.###in the salt water.###.
118347:6	###yeah.### it, it got --n400b41 to be pretty straightforward to understand --n400b68###and, now since then, you know, the closer a car is --n400c5c to a fifty-six buick, the, the more i know --n400c8f about it.###.###.###and then start --n400dcc getting into these nissans and the like###and i just can't keep up.###.###yeah,### i, i agree.	###i never was too mechanically inclined,###but i used --n400ffc to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and,###.
118424:18	###and because the parking brake hadn't been used --n40221c in so many years, the piston froze up.###.###oh.###.###so they ended up --n40230b having --n402316 to pound it out.###and one of them, they, were able --n4023d3 to get --n4023e2 running, uh, --n4023f9 kind of oiling it and playing with it###.###.###and the other one they just, it was just frozen --n402536 --n40253d solid,###so i ended up --n4025fe having --n402609 to buy one	###.###y-,###well, it really wasn't quite, s-, as bad as you thought, was it, was it.
118424:81	###and because the parking brake hadn't been used --n40221c in so many years, the piston froze up.###.###oh.###.###so they ended up --n40230b having --n402316 to pound it out.###and one of them, they, were able --n4023d3 to get --n4023e2 running, uh, --n4023f9 kind of oiling it and playing with it###.###.###and the other one they just, it was just frozen --n402536 --n40253d solid,###so i ended up --n4025fe having --n402609 to buy one	###.###y-,###well, it really wasn't quite, s-, as bad as you thought, was it, was it.
118512:12	###.###yeah.###.###uh, how do you feel about taxes --n4006cb.###.###well, it seems like a big politics game###like up here, last year, the governor was up for re-election###so he said the budget was fine,###the state didn't have any money###and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money	###.###.###and now it's election time again
118534:48	###i've never seen taxes really go down.###.###yeah,###me neither.###well, actually they're going --n400d3a to here because they didn't have a budget for so long###so they raised the tax rate --n400e41 real high for the last three months of this year###and they're going --n400f01 to lower it for next year.###.###oh.###.	###.###i hope they put that in writing.###.
118608:53	###.###and, uh, they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate --n402797.###.###oh.###.### so, and, and you withhold no matter what you do --n40287c,###they withhold what they're supposed --n40294d to --n40295c###and at the end of the year it's not enough.###.###oh, great,	###.###right,###so now, you know, when you sign your w-four form or whatever, w-two whatever that is --n402c68 --n402c6f, then they always say, do you want a extra amount for state. which --n402cb6 is ridiculous,
118717:46	###uh-huh.###they always had a paddle in our school.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###well, they, they just don't do that any more.###.###i know.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.

119662:59	###and i like --n402089 to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish,###but actually catching fish to eat per se, you don't really do much of that right there.###i catch a lot of little old, uh, i think they call them --n4022bc perch###.###right.###.###and then the, the, uh, turtles try --n4023c3 to eat up all my bait.###.###oh.###.	###.### we don't have, we don't have a big problem with turtles,###.

121325:11	###but i had squash,###i had zucchini and, and yellow crook neck squash,###.###.###uh, i guess --n400026 my personal opinion, i, i don't mind --n400055 paying taxes necessarily.### i, i just sometimes wonder if our money is being used --n40016e in the best way.###.###right.###.###uh, sometimes when i hear what, what they're, even what, even what the politicians are making --n4002c6 --n4002cd, you know, when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that --n400318, uh, i think that's just a bit too much to be paying them --n40036b, uh,	###when you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much --n4006b0, it's just billions of dollars###that's, i think --n4007b4 is just being thrown --n4007cb away.###.
121331:38	###.###right.###.###uh, sometimes when i hear what, what they're, even what, even what the politicians are making --n4002c6 --n4002cd, you know, when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that --n400318, uh, i think that's just a bit too much to be paying them --n40036b, uh,###and that's all tax money.###when you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much --n4006b0, it's just billions of dollars###that's, i think --n4007b4 is just being thrown --n4007cb away.###.###right,###right.	###that kind of ticks you off, too.###.###yeah.
121427:7	###but they changed the, uh, deductions on you,###and that just raises your taxes, you know,###they just get it a different way###.###right.###.###so, i mean, to me, it did, uh, raise my taxes.###.###right,###well, i mean, you could tell just by, just by how much money you have --n403599 left --n4035a4 over,	###.###yeah,###i heard someone say that, uh, if they would just, something about with the, uh, the defense budget, all that extra money they're throwing --n40388b back, if they cut back by so much percentage, it could throw back about six hundred dollars, on an average, six hundred dollars,
121430:87	###.###right.###.###so, i mean, to me, it did, uh, raise my taxes.###.###right,###well, i mean, you could tell just by, just by how much money you have --n403599 left --n4035a4 over,###and all of a sudden, i don't know, it's just, it's eating me --n4036fb alive.###.###yeah,	###.###.###what's your favorite t v show --n40002e.
121472:5	###i'm over forty,###and i like it.###i think it's wonderful.###.###yeah,###it's a good show.###i like murphy brown and designing women, too.###.###oh, yeah,###now see, i, we are so busy with,	###and i hardly ever watch t v,###but that's one that, that we watch --n400ab6.###and then sunday nights we watch, uh, life goes on.
121802:82	###.###you know, i want to, i want --n4019d8 to throw some charcoal on the grill and, and throw a steak --n401a17 on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that###but, um,###.###well, that sounds good too.### i have, um, i have three kids###.###uh-huh.###.###so, um, when we have friends over --n401d24 i have my oldest kind of baby-sit for the little two younger ones upstairs	###.###uh-huh.###.
121838:93	###well, i live on a, i live on a lake here,###.###uh-huh.###.### and, uh, so it,###and then during the summertime it --n4025cd's real nice to be able --n4025f0 to entertain outdoors,###.###oh, sure.###.###like that's a little more a casual thing.	###so we, sort of,###a, really good place to do entertaining like that --n40295b.###.

121997:110	###it's not a deterrent, um,###or our jails would not be so full.###there wouldn't be so many people in death row.###.###uh-huh.###.###i think it needs --n400cf1 to be something, uh, uh, a throwback to where they did a, uh, public execution where it's visible --n400d58 --n400d5f.###.###yeah.###.	###if you committed a certain crime, you were going --n4010dc to receive a death penalty###and it was going --n401191 to happen to you.###.
122147:52	###.###um, huh. well, i don't like it when, uh, people listen to my phone conversations, like if they're outside my door while i'm talking in my room --n40018f, or when people like look through my things in my bedroom --n4001c6.###.###.###yeah,###that's right.###that is really an invasion of privacy.###.###yeah.###.	###the solicitors, and the carpet cleaning companies and,###.###uh-huh.
122302:11	###right.###well, occasionally we'll have a person here or there, but not, not as many as the phone calls, you know,###.###uh-huh.###.### so. but,###.###and i guess that's really th-, the thing that --n4029b8 really bugs me the most.###i can't think, tha-,###our kids in our neighborhood used --n402b1a to bother me,	###.###uh,###.
122306:69	###.### so. but,###.###and i guess that's really th-, the thing that --n4029b8 really bugs me the most.###i can't think, tha-,###our kids in our neighborhood used --n402b1a to bother me,###but they've all gotten grown up now###.###uh,###.	###.###oh.###.
122324:83	###especially when you're in a hurry --n402ef3.###.###do you have a lot of traffic in your area.###.###um, it can get busy,###yeah.###usually in the week i'm mumblex.###.###uh-huh.###some days it's real, real bad here,	###.###yeah,###uh-huh.

122574:12	###.###have you seen the rest.###.###yes.###.###i think i've missed one.###i'm not sure,###but i think i've missed one.###.###i actually went to the star trek twenty fifth anniversary marathon that --n4039db happened about a month ago,	###.###was that here in dallas.###.
122588:51	###oh, they had it everywhere,###uh, every major city had one theater that --n403bcf did it###and,###.###okay.###because we had one here in dallas.###.###right,###and they did it in houston,### they did it, well, they did it everywhere.	###and the thing that i didn't realize --n403f86 is that if you watch the movies in a row, uh, time wise they happen one after another and just no, no time between them,###.###uh-huh.
122671:21	###.###yeah,###yeah.### i, i know when i, uh, was going to school --n4019ae it --n4019b9 wasn't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that --n4019ec was misbehaving.###.###exactly.###right.###.###i mean they do that now and they could probably lose their job.###.	###.###yeah,###yeah.
122736:88	###and maybe they should be a little more, uh, uh, concerned with --n4032ae paying the right people --n4032c5 to teach and, and be, uh, satisfied with maybe a little older school.###.###exactly.###because, i mean, here in the town i went to high school,### one of the, there were four high schools in my county, one of the high schools was blown --n403578 away by a tornado.###so when they rebuilt that school --n4036a4, they had a, a top of the line, high tech school there.###.###uh-huh.###.###and the other schools were built --n4037e9 back in maybe the fifties or early sixties	### and this and this and this and so it kind of would make you think that we'd all be better off if all the schools were blown --n403b9b away by tornadoes and we had --n403bba to rebuild them.###.###yeah.
122737:81	###.###exactly.###because, i mean, here in the town i went to high school,### one of the, there were four high schools in my county, one of the high schools was blown --n403578 away by a tornado.###so when they rebuilt that school --n4036a4, they had a, a top of the line, high tech school there.###.###uh-huh.###.###and the other schools were built --n4037e9 back in maybe the fifties or early sixties###and then when, uh, the evaluation committees came through --n4038b7, they praised the school that --n4038d6 had been rebuilt --n4038e9 while they were down grading all these other ones. telling them what they needed --n40392c to do --n40393b --n403942 to fix up this building	###.###yeah.###yeah.

122770:34	###.###it sure is.###i play at least three times a week.###.###uh-huh.###.###i'm on it,###.###i haven't gotten the chance --n40045a lately though to play.###i'm trying --n4004fa to get back into it.	###it's not like riding a bicycle.###you do tend --n4006b4 to, forget.###.
122840:27	###right.###yeah,###you always work on --n401b99 trying --n401ba4 to improve each day###and,###.###yeah,###and i-, inevitably one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another.###either i'm not driving very well###or i'm not hitting long irons very well###or i'm not putting well	###.###yeah.###yeah,
122906:25	###.###.###are you sure you guys aren't having the bad weather.###.###we have cold.###.###yeah.###.###usually january and the first two weeks of february.###.	###.###but, uh, last week we were in the seventies.###something is coming through now
122975:101	###.###uh-huh.###.###i barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then,###so.###.###yeah.###i think it --n40068b's pretty exciting that they can, uh,###it --n400748 would be interesting to see if they can find, uh, other planets that --n40078f are, that --n4007a2 will be more habitable to, uh, you know, uh, humans###and, uh, yeah,	###.###yeah.###well, i wouldn't even mind, uh, --n400bba being a pilot on one,
123522:4	###that's right.### who, who did they play --n402ac6.###.###they played dallas.###.###dallas,###that's right,###.###they won, in overtime.###.	###.###.###that's right.
123677:12	###i mean, this whole ye-, course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, we had, uh, you know, all these, we have all these, uh,###somebody said, you know, you're either a stranger or a fool --n400e29 to try --n400e38 to predict texas weather,###but. well, always, they were saying it was going --n400f5f to be the hottest summer ever,###.###uh-huh.###.	###and it really is not a bad summer at all,###really cool.###but all of a sudden, in, in, uh, in october, uh, september, october it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time.
123678:26	###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, we had, uh, you know, all these, we have all these, uh,###somebody said, you know, you're either a stranger or a fool --n400e29 to try --n400e38 to predict texas weather,###but. well, always, they were saying it was going --n400f5f to be the hottest summer ever,###.###uh-huh.###.###and we had all this rain,	###really cool.###but all of a sudden, in, in, uh, in october, uh, september, october it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time.###and, uh, then the end of october it started --n401385 rain almost a week without stopping,
123680:7	###.###but, uh, we had, uh, you know, all these, we have all these, uh,###somebody said, you know, you're either a stranger or a fool --n400e29 to try --n400e38 to predict texas weather,###but. well, always, they were saying it was going --n400f5f to be the hottest summer ever,###.###uh-huh.###.###and we had all this rain,###and it really is not a bad summer at all,###really cool.	###and, uh, then the end of october it started --n401385 rain almost a week without stopping,###just pouring down, you know.###there were flash floods everywhere,
123737:16	###like, uh today it's, today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day.###.###yeah,###uh, it's,###.###.###yeah,###there, you, you know,###usually there's, uh,###i have a farm a hundred miles east of here in east texas,	###it's that same trees, pines and, and hard woods, you know hickories and oaks and stuff,###.###yeah.
123737:43	###like, uh today it's, today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day.###.###yeah,###uh, it's,###.###.###yeah,###there, you, you know,###usually there's, uh,###i have a farm a hundred miles east of here in east texas,	###it's that same trees, pines and, and hard woods, you know hickories and oaks and stuff,###.###yeah.
123750:38	###yeah.###.###and, uh, i was up there last weekend,###and there are trees that, that --n402b63 still have their leaves on,###and they're green,###but they're dead.###you know, the, the freeze just got them.###.###mumblex.###.	### and, and we haven't had a typical fall at all.###not much color, you know, changes have occurred at all.###really weird this year.
123751:40	###.###and, uh, i was up there last weekend,###and there are trees that, that --n402b63 still have their leaves on,###and they're green,###but they're dead.###you know, the, the freeze just got them.###.###mumblex.###.### they, they weren't ready for it at all apparently,	###not much color, you know, changes have occurred at all.###really weird this year.###i'm not sure what that, what that means --n402fc8.
123752:33	###and, uh, i was up there last weekend,###and there are trees that, that --n402b63 still have their leaves on,###and they're green,###but they're dead.###you know, the, the freeze just got them.###.###mumblex.###.### they, they weren't ready for it at all apparently,### and, and we haven't had a typical fall at all.	###really weird this year.###i'm not sure what that, what that means --n402fc8.###.
123758:26	###mumblex.###.### they, they weren't ready for it at all apparently,### and, and we haven't had a typical fall at all.###not much color, you know, changes have occurred at all.###really weird this year.###i'm not sure what that, what that means --n402fc8.###.###i don't know.###yeah,	###i think it was an especially good winter for fall colors.###.###so you, you all actually had some color, huh.
123761:25	### and, and we haven't had a typical fall at all.###not much color, you know, changes have occurred at all.###really weird this year.###i'm not sure what that, what that means --n402fc8.###.###i don't know.###yeah,###our leaves are, are all on, on the ground now.###i think it was an especially good winter for fall colors.###.	###.###oh, yeah,###yeah.
123810:29	###um.###.### little, little oak tree that --n403b18 was dead, and cut it up and split it mumblex.###.###yeah,###that's because it, it can't tolerate a freeze this early.###is that right.###.###well.###.	###.###uh, it, there's some trees like the oaks,###like the white oaks seem --n403ed9 to be pretty hardy.
124148:68	###.###.###oh yeah,###well, um, that, that sounds, that sounds pretty good for###i know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends, not so much now, but to, um, maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds,###and it --n401375's a lot of work, owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it.###it's###.###it certainly is.###.	###.###well, if you ever get one, be sure the walls are good and thick because if they're not you can hear.### i, that's the main thing when i was shopping for one --n401809,
124179:43	###uh-huh.###so in, in your area then there's probably a lot of, um, career type people that --n401e2e have those type homes###and###.###yes,###definitely.###.###uh-huh,###and, um, the area that we're settled --n401fbc in --n401fc7 is, um, definitely young, young families with, with kids.###they're still doing, um, a lot of building in the neighborhood.	###and, um, seems like a people just don't, or also don't have any family around.###so it, um, also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors --n4024d2,### and you know, um. but, um mumblex,
124211:71	###.###as a matter of fact this is a, uh, this particular community that i live in --n402b0d is very wooded.###.###oh, how pretty.###.###it is nice.###.###i do miss that.###around here in plano there are very few trees###and it's pretty flat and, and kind of barren	### and, and, um, uh, the landscape is much different --n402f96 here in texas than it is, you know, in the north. um, or even where you are --n402ff5.###.###uh, we definitely have a lot of trees here.
124219:24	###around here in plano there are very few trees###and it's pretty flat and, and kind of barren###and that's the only thing that we don't like --n402e15 about --n402e20 living in texas, is we miss all the beautiful trees and the fall### and, and, um, uh, the landscape is much different --n402f96 here in texas than it is, you know, in the north. um, or even where you are --n402ff5.###.###uh, we definitely have a lot of trees here.###.###a lot of leaves to rake --n403202 up too, i bet.###.###yes	###.###does that,###well, see, that's another plus.
124227:9	###.###yes###but fortunately the home owner's association does all that.###.###does that,###well, see, that's another plus.###.###yes,###i don't have --n40340a to worry about that###and this is the time of year we're starting --n4034aa to lose --n4034b9,	###.###that's right,###that's right,
124388:31	###yeah.###.###but now i kind of like, you know, a lot of the bright colors.###.###yeah.###.###i mean, like i used --n4029ed to be more, uh, conservative and just your basic colors,###but now i, i do like some of these, uh, brighter, fluorescent colors.###.###yeah,	###it's just ridiculous,###fads in and out.###and even, um, clothing from the sixties came back.
124405:28	###i see a lot of, um, girls wearing sixties clothes.###.###yeah.### i, i, i guess the, the best thing --n402ea5 i like --n402eb8 to see --n402ec7 from the sixties and seventies is, of course, is the mini skirt, of course.###one of the nice things,###.###.###but, uh,###yeah,###i don't think that there's anything as original,	###they just, um, make their, uh, circle and come back again.###.###yeah.
124461:15	###i was from illinois,###and my favorite team was the white sox.###.###not a cubbies fan, huh.###.###no,###no,### my family, my dad was,###but i turned out --n4005e2 to be a white sox fan.###.	###.###i lived in chicago.###.
124529:44	###i didn't really have one in south dakota.###so i adopted the rangers,###or rather they adopted me, i guess --n401c3d###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, it was just exciting, you know,###you can watch baseball on t v###and they hit the long ball,###and it looks like wow, they really hit that ball.	###.###no.###.
124798:54	###education, raising consciousness awareness,###uh, i know school kids,###i work for the school district here,###and, uh, you know, this is one of the big things with kids.###kids are writing letters to the newspapers about, you know, telling adults --n403bb6 to clean up their act###.###yeah.###.###and, it's uh, you know,###i hope we're not too late with it.	###.###yeah,###well, it, uh,
125328:19	###right.###now they've got a unique fa-, uh, feature in them now.### if, uh, if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed, the e-, the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesn't come through the, so it doesn't go, it doesn't go through the, you know, into the inside.###it'll go underneath the car instead.###.###oh, i didn't know that.###.###so that's, that's a big safety factor they've got --n401fbc in them now.###.###yeah,	###.###the air bags,###yeah.
125449:12	###but i, i, i would go with the general motors any time.###.###well, i've always been a ford man, myself.###.###oh, really.###.###yes.###.###oh.###.	###.###yeah,###well sure.
125502:35	###and in mumblex###of the matter,###you get what you pay for --n400326,###if we're going --n40039b to have national health insurance, which --n4003be seems likely, it's necessarily going --n4003e1 to involve more taxes.###uh, i suspect, i take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the, the economy, that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes, uh, energy taxes, particularly, and that to the extent we need --n4005e6 to raise more taxes --n4005fd, that's the direction we should look --n400628.###.###right.###well, i guess i kind of have mixed feelings.###um, you know, you always sit there###and out of each pay check so much comes out of it,	###.###where's it all going --n400b82.###.
125504:14	###you get what you pay for --n400326,###if we're going --n40039b to have national health insurance, which --n4003be seems likely, it's necessarily going --n4003e1 to involve more taxes.###uh, i suspect, i take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the, the economy, that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes, uh, energy taxes, particularly, and that to the extent we need --n4005e6 to raise more taxes --n4005fd, that's the direction we should look --n400628.###.###right.###well, i guess i kind of have mixed feelings.###um, you know, you always sit there###and out of each pay check so much comes out of it,###and you wonder, you know, where's it all going --n400ae0###.	###.###and we have such a huge, uh, national deficit,### and, and i guess a lot of times there's questions wondering well, if it's doing a whole lot of good.
125647:26	###sure.###.###okay, um###i have three children, um, two, two who --n4002ad are in regular school, uh, eleven year old, an eight year old,###and then my little one, three year old, is in, um, a university of gymnastics,###it's a, a preschool###.###uh-huh.###.###and, um, i think it --n400564 was really hard to, um, to pick the right, uh, day care or preschool or mother's day out.	###.###uh-huh.###.
125750:35	###right.###.###and another consideration is how many infants or children are they, what's the ratio of, of teachers to to children --n402eac###.###to children.###.###.###right.###.###because that makes, a, a, a difference,	###just your child,### and, or do they just put any child in any crib you know,###.
125756:40	###.###right.###.###because that makes, a, a, a difference,###and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day,###just your child,### and, or do they just put any child in any crib you know,###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###.
126008:49	###um, the gas mileage for one thing,###and i've, i've, i've always had like stick shift.### i want --n40158c to, the next car i get --n4015b3 i want it to be automatic.###.###i see.###.### i, uh, i, i hate driving anyway,### and then, and changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now.###.###yeah,	###.###yeah.###.
126027:7	###and i look,###and one of the things with chrysler right now is, is their, the warranties that they have --n401c92,###and i, i feel like their,###everybody i've talked to --n401e41 that --n401e4c owns one, has, has, has been real pleased with it,###and i like the, the driver's air bag,###i like that.###.###now this is a lebaron.###.###uh, yeah,	###but lebaron would be the next car i get --n40219f,###yeah.###.
126083:48	###our first car was an oldsmobile back in seventy-seven.###it was a two door cutlass supreme,###and, uh, it --n403a62 just happened that when we looked for our, our new car --n403a99, they had a thing going with oldsmobile###and if you'd buy a, a new oldsmobile they'd give you four hundred rebate, because it was their seventy-fifth anniversary.###.###uh-huh.###.###i belie-,###yeah###seventy-fifth anniversary.	###and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it.###so we, we got a four door this time,###and i sort of went more for the, uh, the comfort factor,
126119:12	###oh, i'm a,###i play golf###but i don't actually play golf.###.###well, i'm the same way.### i, i go out there and hit the ball.###.###yeah.###.###.	###.###yeah.###.
126133:39	###it's sickening, isn't it.###.###um, uh, well, in the carolinas it's, it's just, you know, we've got a bunch of golf courses around here.###.###yeah.###we've got tons up here###but i don't know.###how do you feel --n4006e6 about your game.###i guess that's a good question.###.	###uh, uh, a friend of mine goes --n400898 golfing a lot###and he drags me out every now and then###and i, uh, i don't have a, i don't really even have a game.
126192:36	###because i, my, my tee off is not bad,###i mean i'm, i'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that###it's just, that, that initial tee.###.###yeah,###what do you do --n402454 when you're putting --n40246b.###that's a good thing.###that's something i could learn --n40254f actually.###that's when i do my worst --n4025ec.###i finally get to the green	###and then,###.###just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really,
126247:24	###it's hard for me.###.### the, the,### it's, it's like i said###once i get up on the green i'm fine,###but that, that tee shot, uh, it, you know,###when --n40385b teeing off --n40386a i-, i'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground###so it, it takes me awhile --n40397d to get to the hole###but,###.	###.###i'm all set.###.
126249:9	### the, the,### it's, it's like i said###once i get up on the green i'm fine,###but that, that tee shot, uh, it, you know,###when --n40385b teeing off --n40386a i-, i'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground###so it, it takes me awhile --n40397d to get to the hole###but,###.###once you're there, you're all set though.###.	###.###we should play team golf then.###.
126276:41	### and, and then, that's according to the hole###and it ju-,###uh, uh, maybe one or two putts.###it's, according to where i'm at --n404245 on the green.###.###yeah.###.###.###that's good.###.	### and, and they're really good.###.###joe pros.
126311:59	###no,###that's not my golf.###that's my friends.### mine, mine,### i'm, i'm usually in the eighties or nineties###so i'm, i'm not good.###.### if, when i'm in the nineties --n404add i'm feeling good.###i'm usually around a hundred.###that's my thing. around a hundred.	###but it ain't going --n404daf to happen.###.###well, i either, --n404e27 teeing off i either slice it or i hook it ever single time
126330:30	###.###.###my t v down.###okay.###i'm sorry.###.###uh, invasions of privacy.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
126475:23	###i think it's gotten much worse the last, few years.###.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###.###maybe that's just because i've gotten on more lists.###.###well, they, you know,### that's, that's the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy.###you've got the holy rollers	###so, um, you know, it's not just the telephone.###.###yeah.
126487:20	###.###yeah.### sell you magazines.###.###.###uh-huh.###i guess whatever is --n4035e6, i just don't give,###.###.###surprised they get anybody this time of day	###.###.###uh-huh.
126592:34	###yeah,### i, i think it --n401634 would be good for, uh, everyone to do something like that###but i, i guess i don't feel like it should be something forced upon you.###.###yeah,###well it, it probably won't.###.###uh-huh.###.### i don't, i don't even know how we'd pay for it --n401981 anyway.	###.###uh-huh.###.
126632:44	###well that would be an eye opener, wouldn't it.###.###wouldn't it though.###.###i mean right next to us is --n402428 such a pitiful country.###.###uh-huh,###it is.###.###i know.	###.###uh-huh.###.
126745:3	###.###uh-huh.###.### and but now it just seems like it's in the dallas fort worth area that i get calls from --n403ac1.###.###yeah,###i've had the same experiences,###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.

128134:15	###speakerb77-2*t77-2.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakeranan*t77-2.###.###and i guess we just kept --n403729 sitting there###.###and then now we make a point of watching.###.###speakera80-1*t80-1.	###speakerbnan*t80-1.###speakerb80-2*t80-2.###uh-huh.
128199:9	###yeah,###they had a big fight on that show, didn't they.###.###speakera101-1*t101-1.###yeah,###speakerbnan*t101-1.###speakerb101-2*t101-2.###yeah.###speakeranan*t101-2.###speakera102-1*t102-1.	###speakerbnan*t102-1.###speakerb102-2*t102-2.###oh, that was awful
128377:49	###and, uh, now what i do --n400e6f,###i mean, i've done this for, you know, like fifteen years,###so you don't start at this kind of regiment, you know.###.###yes.###.###i,###so, what i'm telling you --n4010be isn't something you go out and do --n4010e9### and, and you'll hurt yourself.###uh, every, every, uh,	###but i, uh, i do twenty-five, uh, uh, where you have your arms above your head --n4013ff and and your body twisters touch right, you know, left and right toe###.###uh-huh.
128404:11	###.###yes.###.###.###right.###.###and then i do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups###and, uh, then i do about, uh,###.###my goodness,	###.###oh, yeah,###oh, yeah.
128543:11	###yeah,###yeah.###.###well i, i, uh, i keep --n404563 saying if somebody else would do it with me, i, that would be, little bit of peer pressure would help considerably.###.###well,###.###but you seemed --n4047d0 to have s-, solved that problem without any, any external help.###.###.	###.###and, uh, if you get one of these mats. you know, go to a store, they normally have these exercise, things, these a b c --s of physical fitness on them.###.
128607:33	###.###oh, okay,###so it's right up your alley, then.###.###i suppose so.### let me push the button.###.###all right.###.###okay, uh,	###but, uh, i sense that it's not going --n400363 to happen anytime soon.###.###yeah,
128618:7	###but, uh, i sense that it's not going --n400363 to happen anytime soon.###.###yeah,###i don't think it's going --n400445 to happen either,###but i wish it were###because i'm a, i got my bachelor's in mechanical engineering.###.###uh-huh.###.###i'm at grad school now in acoustics	###.###you're now in what.###.
128629:11	###.###you're now in what.###.###acoustics.###.###acoustics, uh.###.###yeah,###so everything's metric###and then you go --n400834 to read some order book or something	###so i don't understand as much,###so i think we should get one adopted --n40098a permanently.###.
128650:107	###.###they have --n400ef1 to for international trade.###.###yeah.###.###but, i g-, guess it's, it --n400fc1's easier --n400fd4 to switch back and forth than it used --n400fff to be, uh, be-, be-, because of, of, uh, of computers coming into everything.###.###uh-huh.###yeah,###i don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.	###because someone says a kilogram,###no one knows what that is --n401636.###.
128663:54	###.###everyone wants a, wants a conversion of that before --n4016c9 kind of recognizing it as a, as, as, as, as a concept to hold --n401744 in mind.###.###yeah.###.###uh, i, i, i don't see that, it, it, it can change it very quickly.###i mean we're not the kind of society that, that, uh, that something can be posed --n401b50 upon --n401b5b, uh, by government will.###.###yeah,###no one seems --n401ce8 to be adopting it.	###.###uh, the, the, the public is just very conservative that way in --n401ebf refusing --n401eca to change measurement systems, uh, money, dollar, coins, anything like that.###.
128676:43	###.###yeah.###.### and, and, and it, it --n4020c2 obviously makes no sense that we're practically alone in the world in, in --n402109 using the old system.###.###yeah,### i, it's pretty tough when you get everything confused --n4022d2 --n4022d9, though.###i think two systems is worse than one, though.###because, i know, we do a lot of problems and things###and they're half english and half metric	###mumblex just get one.###i prefer metric,###but even if it's english, they should just have one.
128724:16	###so it would be more like, uh, like ninety i guess --n403466,###car is going fifty-five.###uh, you suddenly have a have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now.###.###yeah,###you have a bunch of people trying --n4036bd to do ninety.###.### do, do, do you know, where you are --n40378a, do the schools emphasize the metric system.###.###yeah,	###.###no,### i, i, i meant, i meant down, like, in the elementary schools.
128780:33	###now what was the question --n400fae,### what, what's the criteria for picking a college --n401024.###.###what advice would you give --n4010d9.###.###what advice.###.###.###oh, okay, uh,###.	###.###yes.###.
128794:61	### uh, stay in a dormitory if you can.### go to classes,### talk to faculty members and students.###.###yes,###and also, uh, depending on how, uh, uh, adjustable --n401427 your child would be --n40143e, or, or flexible, i guess it would be, uh,### if, if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe the, they were unused to their, that, the way --n401656 they run things --n401669,###i mean, the, the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges, i think --n401885.###the people are different###and, uh, you have --n4019ae to be more flexible and more willing --n4019d1 to, uh, uh, adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things.	###uh,###.###yes,
128813:80	###.###uh, let's see,###what else.###uh, well, climate would be, you know,###you'd have --n402018 to###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, is somewhat,### if, uh, if it's something different than the one they're used to --n402122, i guess, uh,	###uh,###.###.
129105:9	###.###oh.###.###and nothing got righted --n402d49 until he got back up on the ship.###.###right,###so he kind of was a cowboy type, too.###.###uh-huh###.	###but, uh, jean luke does more of a, a, committee type of management.###.###.
129204:12	###.###.###uh-huh.###well, now, we're pretty close to the golden triangle, aren't you.###.###yeah,### that, that###durham, raleigh, and chapel hill is the triangle.###.###right,	###.###right.###.
129210:11	### that, that###durham, raleigh, and chapel hill is the triangle.###.###right,###research triangle and all of that.###.###right.###.###and, uh, i'm sure you have a lot of students there, uh, and a lot of researchers###so you, you may have a, you know, perhaps a little better economic climate,	###.###yeah,### it's, it's really, it's,
129278:10	###.###well, yeah,### it's, it's, it's pretty bad.###.###well, now, do you find that security is very good in, in a, in a town home.###.###uh, i would say so for the majority in, in our, in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home###.###uh-huh.###.	### and, and, on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving and different things like that.###.###well, that,
129279:47	###well, yeah,### it's, it's, it's pretty bad.###.###well, now, do you find that security is very good in, in a, in a town home.###.###uh, i would say so for the majority in, in our, in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home###.###uh-huh.###.###and we all know one another	###.###well, that,###.
129341:28	###.###.###so, how is the weather --n40002a out there.###.###uh, it's really cold###and it's supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold###and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had.###.###oh, really.###.	###how about you guys.###.###um. uh, it's just, it's a, it's about same.
129349:22	###oh, really.###.###you have, breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff.###how about you guys.###.###um. uh, it's just, it's a, it's about same.###the usual, i think --n4004bd.###.###oh.###.	###it's good.###.###yeah,
129495:23	###.###maybe not that warm.###probably about, uh,###yeah.### it's not, it's not that cold, really.###.###and whenever i remembered the weather reports in utah --n402609, i never really remember them talking too much about wind chill.###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah,###that's a big deal in texas, too.
129585:5	###.###yeah.###.###you have --n4036e3 to have like a three seven --n403702 to get in###so, it's really,###.###that's true.###.###i'm going --n403828 to look into some other fields.###i'd like,	###so i think i better get into something that i can enjoy the process of going to school --n4039f7###.###uh-huh.
129622:21	###.###yeah,###you might know her.###here name is lori, bird.###maybe not.###i think she graduated around then, too, though, eighty-seven probably,###but, she got her doc-,###.###yeah,###well, i can't,	###i can't remember how many people.###.###yeah,
130048:10	###.###yeah,###well, i found out after --n4018c5 washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two.###.###uh, ha.###.###uh, ha,###so it was wasting a lot of time.###yeah.###.	###.###.### thinking i was safe in --n401b73 buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned --n401ba2.
130070:44	###.###yeah.###.###yeah.###.###well, i guess there are some places, uh, in the north, in particular that, uh, --n401ec9 have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle###because they charge you, let's see, they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight.###.###uh, uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah,###i do find that i don't have as much to throw --n4022d3 away because all the bulky things are, are being tossed --n402306 in with the recycling.
130073:56	###yeah.###.###well, i guess there are some places, uh, in the north, in particular that, uh, --n401ec9 have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle###because they charge you, let's see, they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight.###.###uh, uh-huh.###.###so if you recycle things, of course, then you don't have all that weight in there.###.###yeah,	###.###right.###.
130125:31	###kind of a pain to, you know, drive over somewhere special just for that, for two little tiny batteries###but,###.###yeah,###yeah,###but i think the city one could possibly look into that or something.###.###yeah,###that's true.###.	###i'm sure if p-, people will have batteries --n40311c, uh, you know, quite often to, to toss --n40315b out.###.###right,
130132:89	###yeah,###that's true.###.###uh, if they've got these bins for all the other little items,###i'm sure if p-, people will have batteries --n40311c, uh, you know, quite often to, to toss --n40315b out.###.###right,###that's true.###.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
130168:16	###.###wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year.###.###ooh, for those who --n403dab are really cooperating.###.###yeah.###.###now, that would encourage it.###.###well, except i know it would just not be cost effective.	###i'm sure they couldn't afford that.###.###sure.
130282:90	###yeah,###.###so it's more of the easy way out than making them pay for the con-, for the you know, what they've done --n401cad.###.###some people,###.###.###yeah.###.###.	###it --n40218d's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year. to keep people in jail.###.###yeah.
130637:22	###well, do you do any recycling.###.###uh, we do here.###uh, see, what do we recycle --n4000dc.### we, they recycle,###they have bins###.###yeah.###.###and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and, uh, plastic bottles --n400232	###.###oh.###.
130761:49	###but, uh, let's see,###they said that, how, ways, can encourage recycling, uh,###.### i, i, i tell you### what, what --n4025f3 really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, e-, even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it --n4026a2 --n4026a9, you know what i mean --n4026c8, then people tend --n4026df to do it.###uh,###.###yeah,###that's,###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
130798:13	###exactly.###.###you know.###but, uh, i know we had a problem down here with, uh, oil, people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the d-, you know, the s-, the drain sewer.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.	###apparently a lot of people, you know, every time they change the oil --n403711, they just dump all the res-, their old oil down there.###.###uh-huh.
130799:66	###.###you know.###but, uh, i know we had a problem down here with, uh, oil, people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the d-, you know, the s-, the drain sewer.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, all that, because there was,	###.###uh-huh.###.
130879:37	###well, i missed it at first,###but now i go back there###and i'm a real wimp about the cold.###so i like it here.###.###yeah.###.###it's nice.###.###well, that's good.	###.###uh-huh.###.
130933:7	###i guess they want us to describe the area,###so, uh my particular area, the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five, eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million.###.###uh. oh, that's quite a range.###.###.###yes,###uh, the homes that --n40182b were here earlier were smaller.###now they've gotten larger and larger as, as they have developed the land.###and, of course, it's pretty static right now	###.###uh-huh,###yeah.
130964:112	###so i don't i don't even know how high those go --n401f8c,###.###okay.###.###but some of those are pretty big.###.###yes,###those are over a million.###.###yeah.	###they'd all be pretty similar to one another within a, a couple miles.###so,###.
130965:9	###.###okay.###.###but some of those are pretty big.###.###yes,###those are over a million.###.###yeah.###so, it's, that's the strange thing about, i guess, dallas because back where i'm from --n40219b, you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all.	###so,###.###well, we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in dallas.
130973:42	###yeah.###so, it's, that's the strange thing about, i guess, dallas because back where i'm from --n40219b, you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all.###they'd all be pretty similar to one another within a, a couple miles.###so,###.###well, we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in dallas.###.###yeah.###.###not as bad as houston,	###.###uh-huh,###yeah,
130993:46	###or,###.###uh, we've got a house,### let's see,###we moved in about four years ago###and it was, it had previously been unoccupied,###but it had existed for three years.###.###okay.###.	###and, i guess he, he did some crazy thing --n402b21 to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away, type of deal.###.###.
130997:15	###we moved in about four years ago###and it was, it had previously been unoccupied,###but it had existed for three years.###.###okay.###.###this is a whole block of homes that, uh, a builder built all of --n402a32 them###and, i guess he, he did some crazy thing --n402b21 to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away, type of deal.###.###.	###.###oh.###.
131026:10	###.###so we just, you know, we bargained --n4031b4 to get an extra warrantee on that.###.###i see.###.###and, uh, we're really, we haven't had any problems###and, you know, we had originally thought we'd have --n4033ca to get a fix up special or something because --n4033f5 being from the northeast we figured we couldn't afford anything.###but the prices are much lower here###and this was definitely not a fix up special,###but i'll tell you,	###.###.###between, we put in our own sprinkler system and i just finished --n403712 repainting the exterior and, you know, making drapes and buying furniture, it's just a money pit.
131152:21	###huh, that's interesting.###.###.###that's a bummer, though.###.###yeah###it is.###.###i mean, you got --n11b43 to take the time off.###.	###.###.###you do.
131156:20	###.###yeah###it is.###.###i mean, you got --n11b43 to take the time off.###.###you have --n11be2 to save all of your, uh, vacation time.###.###.###you do.	###and that's usually how it's, uh, happened --n11d5e,###.###yeah.
131275:14	###you only have --n13966 to check in with the office once or twice a week###and,###.###yeah.###.###course, they're talking about, uh, that we're going --n13a86 to be able --n13a99 to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that,###.###oh, i kn-,###.###.	###.###so, uh, it --n13c80 would be kind of exciting in some ways to, to see a little bit more of that###and some ways, it might be kind of scary.
131408:60	###sometimes that's okay.###.###i know.###.###because,###.###that's what my mother said --n401583 one time.###.###you know,###right,	###.###right.###.
131424:15	###that's true,###and if they force them to, you know that's not good either.###.###yeah.###.###.###that becomes a drudgery###and,###well, let's see,###.	###.### n-, got, of the six, we've got four --n401a62 around here.###.
131691:28	###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, i was raised --n400aee by a man, my stepfather who, with a two handicap, i mean, he, he, he, --n400b61 he could get down on his knees and hit the ball, i mean, further than most people could hit it.###.###sure.###.### and my mother who --n400e1e is now, he's, my stepfather is dead, but my mother who --n400e65 is now seventy-one, i can remember her being, i believe --n400ea0 a sixteen --n400eaf or a fourteen --n400ec2 handicap,###.###.	###they'd leave work and go to a golf course, or a little country club --n40122f they belonged to --n401246 back in richmond, virginia and just, uh, play nine holes of golf.###.###yeah.
131917:11	###.###yeah,### and, and, uh, upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled###and now, now it's, now it's a fast machine.###.###well, that's,###.###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah.###what do you use it for --n4009af.
131946:108	###man.###.###uh, i've done business programming, scien-, you know, scientific applications like, you know, petroleum science stuff and, uh, uh, test equipment###.###.###and i did the, i, i did one that --n400e5f was, the demonstration of a touch, touch screen for a company that --n400e9e sells, uh, touch screens.###it was kind of fun.###.###uh-huh,###.	###.###huh.###.
132040:19	###.###in richardson there.###.###huh.###.###in richardson.###.###uh-huh.###.###i know where you mean --n402962.	###that's about lookout there, i think, isn't it.###.###right,
132560:59	###that's the one that --n401332 really kind of bothers me.###.###well, i think that, uh, that the problem with the sales tax, of course, is it's an unfair tax across the board, uh, as far as ability to pay, which a-, allegedly, allegedly taxes are supposed --n4014a5 to be directed --n4014b8 towards --n4014c3.###but, uh, now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of, you know, taxes on everything they buy --n401776,###and where people that make, you know, two hundred, three hundred thousand dollars a year --n4018bc, certainly a portion of that, they aren't going --n4018ef to be paying taxes on --n40190a, you know.###and, uh, that's the unfair equity, inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue,###but i don't think it is anymore,###not in texas anyway.###.###oh, i got you,	###.###that's right,###that's right.
132616:21	###.###and where you exempt things, like, uh, uh,###one of the best things i heard --n403490 on taxes to stimulate the economy, someone, brilliant deductor, probably lloyd bentsen, said that all, you know, if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be, you know, spending more money --n403557 using their credit cards.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###now, i don't know if that's true or not,	###.###sure.###.
132732:10	###.###oh, my goodness.###.###well, you know, we took the skin and the head and the le-, and the feet off,###and that was about, you know, a hundred, hundred pounds of just ham.###.###oh, well, how many people are you planning on --n401f73 serving --n401f7e at christmas.###.###oh, well, we're, you know, we're not going --n40205c to eat the whole thing.###.	###yeah.###.###it would take a year.
132852:11	###.###so everything that --n403f92 lives around here is real tough.###.###oh.###.###that's trees, you know,###we got hundred year old trees that --n4040c1 are, you know, twenty feet tall.###.###oh, gee.###.	### they, you know, they're just hard as a rock.###.###.
132871:59	###.###well, what kind of car would i want --n4000ab to buy --n4000ba.###.###yeah.###.###i don't know.###the question is, i mean, would i want --n4001cc to buy,###or would i, would i probably actually buy.### may be two different things.###.	###.###if i had all the money i wanted --n4004e9, then that's whole different matter.###.
132873:15	###.###yeah.###.###i don't know.###the question is, i mean, would i want --n4001cc to buy,###or would i, would i probably actually buy.### may be two different things.###.###oh, well, if you, if you had all your, all the money in the world or something.###.	###.###.###no,
133117:21	###it was a real old one###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, i bought that --n404180 used.###i had absolutely no money to my name and bought that,###and it served me real well, too.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###.
133229:21	###oh, really.###no.###.###yeah,###i forgot the name of the town.###i thought maybe it was you.###.###.###oh, well, anyway, we're supposed --n400583 to talk about education.###i certainly have some ideas since i'm studying it now in college.	###.###uh-huh.###.
133285:9	###another problem is you're going --n401507 to keep the smarter people in the system too long --n401536 paying the wages they do --n401555.###.###right.###.###but, um,###.###so do you, what --n4016b9 do you think --n4016d0 is good about the schools.###.###that --n4017ad is good about,###well, it depends on where you are --n40182a.	###that's another thing about the united states.###.###yeah.
133336:59	###but do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum.###.###i don't know.###i just read about that the other day,###and i had never even thought of it.###actually it makes sense to a certain extent,###because sometimes, like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that --n402a8c didn't even learn what, uh, they should --n402ac3 --n402aca to do the work that she is supposed --n402af1 to teach --n402b00, you know. mumblex and according to her plan,###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###.
133446:20	### i'm, i'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the, uh, the idea that, that, uh, that decreasing taxes, particularly the kinds that --n401ea5 are being recommended --n401eb8 bye-bye the bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going --n401efb to, uh, result in substantial amounts of money, you know, for consumers to spend --n401f4e.###and, uh,###.###yeah,###i'm not sure how i feel --n4022df about --n4022ea paying on the quest, the long term quests that tax cuts are worth --n402329 at this point.###it's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is --n40248c.###.###yeah,### it, uh, it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do --n402578.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
133471:70	###.###it's a sort of a piece of luck.###.###that's the upside to the recession.###.###yeah, um.###i don't know,###what kind of things do you think --n402d0e can be done --n402d21 in, in, uh, in the long term.###.###mumblex well, can be done --n402e84 or will be done --n402e9f are two different things.	###.###sure.###.
133477:16	###i don't know,###what kind of things do you think --n402d0e can be done --n402d21 in, in, uh, in the long term.###.###mumblex well, can be done --n402e84 or will be done --n402e9f are two different things.###um, at various places to look --n402f89 for, for cutting the budget, first of all i consider more defense cuts than are already planned --n402fe4 depending on the world situation.###.###sure.###.###but there are various other areas such as, as farm subsidies that --n4031bc ought --n4031c7 to be slashed --n4031da.###uh, a lot of entitlement programs, like education aid, i think, uh, they should put a, in	###.###uh-huh.###.
133519:26	###yeah.###.###.###you've done.###.###our most recent series of projects i guess --n400074, was, inside was, uh, we remodeled a bathroom recently.###.###well, how did it go --n4001c5.###.###well, it went pretty well, uh, other than the fact that we encountered some, uh, problems that you run across --n40027c in older homes with plumbing, which one thing led to another --n4002b3,	###.###gee, like starting over, i guess --n400610.###.
133519:103	###yeah.###.###.###you've done.###.###our most recent series of projects i guess --n400074, was, inside was, uh, we remodeled a bathroom recently.###.###well, how did it go --n4001c5.###.###well, it went pretty well, uh, other than the fact that we encountered some, uh, problems that you run across --n40027c in older homes with plumbing, which one thing led to another --n4002b3,	###.###gee, like starting over, i guess --n400610.###.
133552:11	###um, you've got an older house.###.###yes.###.###they are built --n400b49 --n400b50 a little bit more sturdy than,###.###well, that's the thing that --n400c05 surprised me, because once i got into the plumbing everything in there was copper,###.###right.###.	###.###oh, is that right.###.
133564:33	###oh, is that right.###.###that's what --n400dfc drove me bananas, because, you know, i'm going to the hardware store --n400e43 saying give me plastic pipe and and cement to fit them together --n400e86###.###yes.###.###.###mumblex.###.###and nothing wanted --n40105c to go,	###.###and just start at square one.###.
133564:58	###oh, is that right.###.###that's what --n400dfc drove me bananas, because, you know, i'm going to the hardware store --n400e43 saying give me plastic pipe and and cement to fit them together --n400e86###.###yes.###.###.###mumblex.###.###and nothing wanted --n40105c to go,	###.###and just start at square one.###.
133572:12	###.###and nothing wanted --n40105c to go,###so it was like i had --n4010cc to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over.###.###and just start at square one.###.###really.###.###uh.###.	###.###well, and then if you do it wrong.###.
133578:10	###really.###.###uh.###.###that was an all day job, just to get it plumbed --n40127a.###.###well, and then if you do it wrong.###.### fortunately, i was very fortunate, uh, in the fact that, uh, when i made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on --n401414 nothing leaked,###.	###.###everything worked.###and i just said, that's marvelous.
133597:10	###left a fitting loose, or didn't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that.###.###right.###.###.###yes.###.###.###right.###.	###so i, i felt pretty fortunate about that.###.###all worked out all right, huh.
133600:13	###.###.###yes.###.###.###right.###.###but it all came together,###so i, i felt pretty fortunate about that.###.	###.###how about you.###.
133701:10	###well, that was the first time i've ever wallpapered --n403215,###and, uh,###.###kind of fun, isn't it --n4032f2.###.###that's an education in itself.###.###really.###.###but, uh, the dye lots, uh, must have been a little bit different from,	###.###repeating patterns is what you have --n4035c4 to check for --n4035d7 when you, when you buy your paper --n4035fe.###.
133749:85	###then you had --n403f40 to cut around the closet and cut around a window###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh,###.###i've had my best luck in papering when i start in the middle of a wall --n404097,	###.###and start right there.###.
133997:43	###uh-huh.###.### in, in fact, quite frankly i've owned a volvo in the past,###and uh, i've, i've,###.###uh-huh.###.###they're expensive cars to keep --n4029d3 up when they need service --n4029ee,###but, uh, i've found that i've had a lot of luck with them.###uh, course i'm a mechanically inclined kind of person,	###and i guess that's one thing that, that --n402e27 recommends the honda to a lot of people, is --n402e56 is there's just very little that you have --n402e85 to do --n402e94 under the hood,###and, uh,###.
134003:19	###.###they're expensive cars to keep --n4029d3 up when they need service --n4029ee,###but, uh, i've found that i've had a lot of luck with them.###uh, course i'm a mechanically inclined kind of person,###and i always wind up --n402c35 getting under the hood and finding out all the things that, you know, --n402c78 need to be taken care of --n402c9b, and so forth.###and i guess that's one thing that, that --n402e27 recommends the honda to a lot of people, is --n402e56 is there's just very little that you have --n402e85 to do --n402e94 under the hood,###and, uh,###.###yes,###it just, just sits there and purrs,	###i get six hundred miles on a tank of gas.###.###oh, i know.
134122:106	###.###well, uh, in dallas, i, i haven't seen air pollution quite on a, quite on a level that we had --n400cf5 in denver.###i grew up in denver,### and, and i've lived there most of my life,###and we used --n400f57 to have those, uh, you know, the posted warning days.###uh, however, in colorado now, they have the emissions control law, which --n401087 has really cut down,###probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have --n40119e to po-, post warnings --n4011b9 now, you know, as far as health concerns.###.###um.###.	###.###wisconsin has a, a law in which we need --n401614 to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag --n401657 and they are tested --n40166e for, uh, their pollution control equipment --n401695,###.
134146:6	###and i thi-,###you know, there seem --n401b71 to be, at least in certain little pockets,###and we were talking earlier about madison###.###uh-huh.###.###madison has one of the nicest, uh, bike, uh, road, uh, sharing programs of, of any city in wisconsin###.###oh, really.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
134228:25	###i had talked with my parents.### i, i grew up, uh, i was born --n40393c in, uh, muncie, indiana, and, and grew up a little bit in terre haute,###and i had asked them before, uh,###i went back --n403b63 to visit recently, about a year ago,###and i asked them,###i said, did you ever realize the air pollution that --n403c70 was,###.###.### let's see,###my husband does the majority of the, um, the, uh, gardening, uh, taking care of the lawn and fertilizing,	###.###uh-huh.###.
134233:15	###i said, did you ever realize the air pollution that --n403c70 was,###.###.### let's see,###my husband does the majority of the, um, the, uh, gardening, uh, taking care of the lawn and fertilizing,###but, i, um, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying and, um, --n400217 taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in, you know, throughout that season, and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and, um, any kind of decorating for the holidays, you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###i'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for halloween and christmas,	###and i do all the fun stuff.###.###well, we have it just opposite here.

134267:33	###because when we got this place --n400bfa the, the dirt was just overgrazed###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, you know, it was bare dirt in a lot of places###.###uh-huh.###.###and now, you know, since we've been mowing it,###and, you know, of course we water a little bit,	### but but just by keeping it mowed --n401000 and getting it mulched --n401017 in, we've reclaimed a lot of it.###.###oh, sure.
134385:48	###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###so.###.###right.###well, i put,###.	###and we have morning glory###.###uh-huh.
134395:47	###on the other side of the house, though, that's where we have all the, the delicate flowers and the mums --n403418,###and we have morning glory###.###uh-huh.###.###and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers,###and we planted those out by the septic, so that, uh, they get plenty of water###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###oh.###.
134488:20	###.### i, i, i worked on some of it at t i once upon a time.###.###oh, have you.###.###yeah.###.###so what do you know --n40083f about it.###.###well, actually i'm, i, i'm quite versed lately.	###and people are talking about, about the current space program all the time.###they're talking about new rockets that they're designing --n400af9 now that, you know, --n400b18 are just like science fiction, you know,###it's like they, take off, you know,
134489:42	### i, i, i worked on some of it at t i once upon a time.###.###oh, have you.###.###yeah.###.###so what do you know --n40083f about it.###.###well, actually i'm, i, i'm quite versed lately.###i get on a computer network all the time,	###they're talking about new rockets that they're designing --n400af9 now that, you know, --n400b18 are just like science fiction, you know,###it's like they, take off, you know,###.
134554:9	###.###i don't know if we'll ever see that up there.###.###well at least we're going --n401dc9 to have a space station supposedly in the next few years.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah,###and they're going --n401ef1 to put,###.	###.###yeah.###.
134560:46	###.###yeah,###and they're going --n401ef1 to put,###.###that's all beyond my imagination really.###.###yeah.###.###but, science fiction books,###i mean, you look at the jetsons, you know, cartoon show,	###so you never know.###.###oh, yeah,
134595:32	###yeah,###i, uh,### it's, it's, it's something --n402859 definitely that, uh, you know,### it's, it's, uh, got the extra little oomph of interest.###.###yeah.###.###uh.###.###i'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too, once it becomes, you know, like it's more possible,	###.###yeah.###.
134612:74	###like, uh, boeing or mcdonald douglas or something like that was supposed --n402e11 to buy, uh, a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it, you know, purely commercial###.###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they'd go up, you know, and do things###and,###.	###.###oh.###.
134612:88	###like, uh, boeing or mcdonald douglas or something like that was supposed --n402e11 to buy, uh, a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it, you know, purely commercial###.###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they'd go up, you know, and do things###and,###.	###.###oh.###.
134622:31	###so did they scratch those, uh, that star wars deal, you know, they one we was all worried about russia and all that --n4030f0.###.###oh.###.###.###no,###it's still probably going,###but i don't know whether, it, it, research will go on.###.###yeah,	###.###oh, yeah.###.
134667:14	###and now they're saying, yeah,###yeah,###you're a republic,###you don't want those,###you don't want those. mumblex.###.###some crazy hit man over there###so, with those little republican-, republics or whatever###.###.	###and one of them crazy crazy guys get a hold of it,###.###uh-huh.
134752:45	###that's true.###.###and, uh i'm insulating myself from that problem.###.###exactly what --n400e26 happened to them.###.###i'm building my own house.###.###oh, that's nice.###.	###.###oh, really.###.
134899:12	###yeah.###.###but, in the house itself, i've been working inside, you know, these, lo-, these many months###.###uh-huh.###.###and i have not had --n40318b to use the heat.###.###wow.###.	###.###yeah.###that's pretty good.
134906:19	###.###wow.###.###because it's all geothermal.###.###yeah.###that's pretty good.###.###and with all the,###see i've got,	###well, as much as i could get in it, you know.###and, uh, the east side is glass.###.
134913:14	###.###and with all the,###see i've got,###on the south side is all glass.###well, as much as i could get in it, you know.###and, uh, the east side is glass.###.###yeah.###.###i've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet.	###.###wow.###.
134954:65	###um, i see.###.###and the side that --n403d4b's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high.###.###oh.###.###so i've got a pretty good grade there.###.###yeah.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
135051:20	###well, it isn't###and it is.###it is, you know,###actually the sewing isn't the hard part,###it's just being able --n401043 to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room.###.###measure it and get it to,###.###.###well, if it, it depends on how elaborate you get it --n4011fd.	###.###yeah,###i've been doing that
135122:15	###and, what, i'm, what i think now --n40224f is the reason is i kept the tank too clean###.###oh, you're kidding###.###because you have,###.###because they need --n402418 to have a little bit of the,###.###right,###you need --n4024d7 to let the bacteria build up,	###.###i see.###.
135130:15	###right,###you need --n4024d7 to let the bacteria build up,###and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance.###.###i see.###.###and i would just take everything out and just like, you know, wash it with scalding hot water###.###oh, no.###.	###and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again###.###and so you'd have --n402821 to start all over --n402838 to build that up probably.
135131:18	###you need --n4024d7 to let the bacteria build up,###and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance.###.###i see.###.###and i would just take everything out and just like, you know, wash it with scalding hot water###.###oh, no.###.###and it would kill all the bacteria,	###.###and so you'd have --n402821 to start all over --n402838 to build that up probably.###.
135133:28	###.###i see.###.###and i would just take everything out and just like, you know, wash it with scalding hot water###.###oh, no.###.###and it would kill all the bacteria,###and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again###.	###.###so.###.
135187:13	###.###no,###not yet.###.###fifty-five gallons, you'd hope it would never do that.###.###that's right,###i really do.###but, you know.###.	###or,###.###yeah,
135266:10	###.###right.###.###and on occasion if you get a real small one, it'll fit out the slots.###.###it'll go through the slot.###.###that's right,### so. but, you know, it works, i guess --n4044cf.###.	###they don't, uh, want the mothers to be with the little fish either.###.###oh, they'll eat them.
135361:50	###.###oh###.### and i was thinking yeah, and i was thinking###.###birmingham.###.###the only birmingham i could think of --n4003bb was alabama.###.###right.	###.###yeah,###well, tell me what kind of books have you read --n4005b7.
135407:100	###if it's not a heavy biography, you know i enjoy it.###.###right.###.###.###i used --n400f7f to like --n400f8e to read about royalty a lot.### i, when i was younger --n40104a i read about every king and queen that --n401071 lived, i think, in europe.###that was my thing for a while.###.###i was trying --n40120b to think, uh,	###and there was a murder.###.###oh, really.
135612:29	###that's exactly what i was going --n4048c8 to say --n4048d7.###i was amazed --n404972,###because i,###in the beginning when it was on, you know, on route coming out --n404a1d i heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.	###.###me, either.###do you know anyone that --n404db8's read it.
135657:52	###.###i don't know.###i fly for a living,###and i've, uh,###the weather's been terribly unusual every where i've been --n4005d1.###.###oh, you do###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah.###.
135666:189	###.###so you, you, you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather.###.###yeah.###.###i imagine it --n4007f6's kind of an experience also trying --n40081d to land and take off in the weather.###.###well, it was around here last night,###i'll tell you that.###.	###.###no kidding.###.

136429:42	###.###well, that sounds like a lot of fun.###.###well, usually what you do --n4030ff is just wait until you think it's stopped,###and then you patch them up.###.###um.###what is it --n40327d###like, uh, stucco walls or,###.	###.###oh, drywall.###.

136733:29	###whereas, uh, i'm the type of person, --n404220 i could not sit,###well, i shouldn't say i could not,###but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without --n4043c1 doing something.###.###yeah,###yeah,###me too.###.###.###yeah,	###yeah,###.###because they talk so much,
136775:32	###uh-huh.###.###i like, um, --n4002d7 driving to different cities because of the scenery,###so that was nice.###.###so you,###most of yours is kind of driving###and,###.###yeah,	###um, it's very pretty driving like, um, up north in wisconsin too.###.###um, how, how far do you usually end, end up --n40067e driving --n400689 just,
136872:11	###.###um, oh, it's a, like a huge amusement park um,###they have water slides###.###okay.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and it's just a big, big tourist attraction.	###and, it's, it's really neat.###i don't think, uh, hardly anybody lives there,###because it's just kind of like, you know, tourists.
136903:16	###.###yeah,###so that's nice.###.###sure.###.### it's, it's a pretty ride up there, too.###i really like the city wausau in wisconsin.###it's really pretty.###it's nice out there.	###.###right,###well, and you can probably,
136995:53	###.###.###it's been because of the size or some problem like that.###.###right.###.###i really haven't had --n4001fb to return things because they didn't perform the way they were supposed --n40023a to --n400249.###.###most the time they have a pretty good guarantee,###yeah.	###and, uh, i-, it takes them less than a day###and they're broken in one way or another.###but i don't know if that's just kids, or if that's, uh,
137042:24	###.### don't remember her breaking, uh,###.###no,###i don't.###but i also don't remember lots of little pieces###they've got so many different things with it now.###.###well, that's one thing they've got --n401470.###they've got every type of imaginable,	###and, uh###.###goodness.
137349:55	###well, there is lots of pretty country further west.###.###oh, yeah.###.###yeah.###.###we're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school --n4022c6 to head that way.###.###yeah.###yeah,	###.###oh, yeah.###.
137445:44	###what,###well, you went out from texas up in, into that area.###.###uh-huh,###yeah.### we went, uh, we took the southern route and went, went through, uh, uh, the grand canyon, again###and we stopped at, uh, uh, las vegas for a couple of nights, and then, uh, went into malibu in california over on the coast.###.###yeah.###.	###.###okay.###.
137454:60	###.###and then we went up the, the big sur highway all the way up to san francisco. and, uh, and then cut across through the wine country. and then went down to, to, uh, sequoia national park.###.###okay.###.###.###oh, wow.###.###.###okay,	###.###oh, yeah.###.
137469:28	###uh, well, uh, the cowboys are my favorite team.###that's pretty easy to say --n4000bd nowadays.###.###.###lot easier than it was a couple years ago,###but they had a big win today.###uh, did you get --n40023a to watch it.###.###no,###i didn't.	###so,###.###oh.
137550:9	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right,###yeah,###uh, you know, they have a young team.###it's, you know, a lot different than the teams they used --n401874 to have --n401883 where it's the same old, you know, players --n4018b6 every year and, you know, same coach, same everything --n4018ed,###so, now it's, you know, like a taste of something different.	###.###.###now it's like, you know, tough and dirty team
137562:55	###.###now it's like, you know, tough and dirty team###so everybody is really excited.###and,###.###who is the competition going --n401d67 to be --n401d76.###.###well, it's supposed --n401df5 to be the redskins,###but you know, we beat them already.###we beat them this year in, in washington	###but, you know, it's just that we have --n4020ce to play every game away, you know,###it's going --n4021ce to be tough,### but, but every-,
137819:26	###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, i got down here in june of eighty-four,###and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they'd seen --n401f26 in twenty years,###and it --n401ff3 was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane, manly, adult men into playful little children --n40204e.###.###oh, i know.###.###we had this group of, uh, surveyors come into, uh, a shop i was working in --n4021ba, uh, four or five of them,	###they had just come in --n402393 to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked --n4023c6.###but, while they were there they set back, drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles threw snowballs all over the place, had themselves a ball for about an hour.###.
137821:90	###.###but, uh, i got down here in june of eighty-four,###and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they'd seen --n401f26 in twenty years,###and it --n401ff3 was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane, manly, adult men into playful little children --n40204e.###.###oh, i know.###.###we had this group of, uh, surveyors come into, uh, a shop i was working in --n4021ba, uh, four or five of them,###these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place.###they had just come in --n402393 to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked --n4023c6.	###.###oh, no.###.
137858:50	###but that's only available if, with the traction control and the other option.###.###yeah.###.###and those two are sold --n402f1d together###so you have --n402f73 to take a two thousand dollar option there --n402f9a to to, uh, do it,###.###ouch.###.###so i, i opted not for that but,	###.###no,###it doesn't sound real necessary in texas.
137948:18	###oh, has he.###.###so,###.###then how does he like it --n40097a.###.###oh, he's loved it.###he is a senior in high school this year###so he's,###.	###.###.###yeah,
138270:24	###.###and,###.###uh, that, that's partly my problem now.###i don't have room for this.### i, uh, i,### where, uh, where we lived --n403484 before up north, uh basements were, were common###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###.###but not so here in texas.
138334:8	###just because of the,###.###well, too many kids and, and i think --n4004c6 too many infections and things coming in.###.###yeah,###they seem --n4005c3 to pass a lot of,###.###yeah,###sicknesses and,###i don't know,	###.###yeah,###you kind of wonder whether or not,
138372:78	###but i only had her going two days###and most of the other kids were going more days###so that was probably my own fault that she didn't,###.###oh.###.###.###she went,###.###oh, you know, one thing i noticed --n40102c is, uh, uh, just, they were trying to get her --n401073 to, teach her --n40108a to write her name,	###.###oh, she did.###.
138381:15	###oh, you know, one thing i noticed --n40102c is, uh, uh, just, they were trying to get her --n401073 to, teach her --n40108a to write her name,###and, uh, i didn't notice it until this summer when i was working with her --n401270 that she would bend her wrist all the way, oh, not in a natural sh-, form.###.###oh, she did.###.###yes,###and, uh, i was kind of m-, mad that they had never noticed that and, either pointed it out to me or, or, uh tried --n4014f4 to say, look, you're holding your,###she was holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff.### sh-, but she was,###.	###.###yes.###.
138387:38	###and, uh, i was kind of m-, mad that they had never noticed that and, either pointed it out to me or, or, uh tried --n4014f4 to say, look, you're holding your,###she was holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff.### sh-, but she was,###.### wrapping her arm all the way around.###.###yes.###.###yeah.###.	###she was four, or three,###yeah,### she was, uh, it was last year
138466:116	###.###yeah,### it, it --n402d77 is, i think --n402d92, just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will --n402df1.###.###well, and you know their, kind of their schedules###and you know if they're upset and that type of a deal.###.###yeah,###yeah.###.	###i think it's,###well, i don't know,### then, then on the other hand i think it --n4033ea's harder to stay home in some regards.
138542:135	###did you read, uh, the article in the paper today about this particular subject.###.###in the dallas, the morning times.###.###yeah.###.###i guess i did not.###.###uh, the state of washington and the state of minnesota is, uh, going --n400635 to begin --n400644 testing a program, a state funded program for citizens of those two states###and there's fourteen other, uh, states that --n4007e6 are considering it. least according to the article in the paper this morning.	###it's getting to a point that you have --n400bb7 to have it --n400bca,###you have --n400c7c to have some form of health insurance.###.
138614:10	###i had a bad experience as it turned out.###uh, i was fortunate that there was parkland.###.###is your wife better, i hope.###.###uh, no###she passed away.###.###i'm real sorry.###.	###.###sure.###.
138642:26	###.###and i feel very strongly about, uh, children, and, uh, developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year. where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who --n40278e need it most --n4027a1.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, uh, i'm really quite active in --n4029e2 trying --n4029ed to, uh, be proactive --n402a0c at least for children's issues.###it's very complex, very complicated,	###.###well, i, when i grew up and###i grew up in south central kansas, uh,
138650:17	###so, uh, i'm really quite active in --n4029e2 trying --n4029ed to, uh, be proactive --n402a0c at least for children's issues.###it's very complex, very complicated,###but, uh, i strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization, glasses, hearing aids, basic health benefits.###.###well, i, when i grew up and###i grew up in south central kansas, uh,###we had,###and my mom worked for the health department, the county health department###and we had x-rays every year,###we had a dentist come to our school and, uh, check our teeth once a year at least.	###.###um.###.
138650:63	###so, uh, i'm really quite active in --n4029e2 trying --n4029ed to, uh, be proactive --n402a0c at least for children's issues.###it's very complex, very complicated,###but, uh, i strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization, glasses, hearing aids, basic health benefits.###.###well, i, when i grew up and###i grew up in south central kansas, uh,###we had,###and my mom worked for the health department, the county health department###and we had x-rays every year,###we had a dentist come to our school and, uh, check our teeth once a year at least.	###.###um.###.
138668:13	###.###well, and the costs have, so much has gone up so much.###the cost of immunizations for example, uh, and just the legal, the legal benefits, uh,###that has really forced people into --n40367c doing a lot of things unnecessarily, et cetera.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, well, i don't know,### it's, it is interesting,###in case you didn't know, texas leads the nation in uninsured children.	###.### did not know that.###.
138682:4	###so, uh, one out of every three children has nothing --n403a40 to reimburse them for their health care.###and i work in the children's parkland system###and it's pretty overwhelming to me.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, it --n403c1a's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in dallas county.###.###.###okay,	###uh, what do you think --n40007f about it.###.###uh, i think it's a real good concept.
138812:8	###yeah,###then he's been working for the company for a while, too.###he, uh,###.###yeah.###.###good company, uh,###.###oh, yeah.###.	###he's telling me about good profit sharing and all that,###.###company's,

138879:51	###yeah,###you get hired --n403d59,###then you come in the first,###i,### seems to me i remember that, uh, i was hired --n403e4f, came in and went through some orientation###and i thought i,###boy, i can't remember.###that would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test.###maybe it was during the interview.###i came up a couple times for an interview,	###but, uh, i guess, just like other companies, other friends i've been hearing about --n404322 that --n40432d have been moving around,### it's, it's before.###they have --n4044d8 to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment,
138973:38	###.###well, today it's not bad out there.###.###no,###it's nice.###i just came in from outside###.###uh-huh.###.###and it's, it's really pretty.	###.###yeah.###.
139116:42	###well, it's based --n402ff8 here,###uh, the international headquarters for wycliff bible translators is right here in, in dallas.###.###so you're, you're with the home office now.###.###yeah,###right now i am.###that's what --n403254 brought me here,###yeah.###.	###the weather you know, does change fast###.###yeah.
139116:49	###well, it's based --n402ff8 here,###uh, the international headquarters for wycliff bible translators is right here in, in dallas.###.###so you're, you're with the home office now.###.###yeah,###right now i am.###that's what --n403254 brought me here,###yeah.###.	###the weather you know, does change fast###.###yeah.
139190:36	###.###okay.###well, i'm a vietnam era veteran,###and, uh, i was, uh, fortunate not --n400160 to have --n40016f to serve in the theater,###however, my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation.###uh, i'm of the old school that --n400351 believes that, uh, the, uh, uh, contracts that we made --n400394 back years ago needed --n4003ab to be honored --n4003be.###however, uh, i think we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker.###uh, but those are my personal thoughts,###and i think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run world war two we'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people.###but as it was, the politicians ran the, the korean conflict and ultimately the vietnam thing,	###and so this is what --n400a2b trigger-, ultimately triggered us, uh, united states, uh, per se, being, uh, deciding --n400a92 to get out of the role of world policeman.###your views,###.
139206:16	###well.###.###uh, france was there first.###they had,###.###we got into it because of seato agreement --n400e81, back just right after world war two that,###uh, we pledged a mutual, uh, uh, defense of, of the south vietnamese,###and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another,###and really we### i, i question us, you know, now,	###.###sure.###.
139395:83	###uh, actually one thing we have done --n401478 quite a bit through the holidays, just because it's a, real easy, is just baked potato dinners.###.###oh, yeah,###uh-huh.###.###and have, you know, like three or four couples come over,###and i'll do the potatoes and you know, like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings, whatever they like --n401758###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah,###that's fun.
139686:18	###mumblex we were thinking about --n4006f6 getting a dog if we get into a house.###.###yeah.###.###uh, someplace where there, you know,###we can take care of it and everything.###we've got, some children who --n4008fd would just really, uh, enjoy --n400920 having an animal, you know, a dog, i think --n40095b###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah.###.
139927:48	###yeah.###.###yeah.###.###most the class are pretty small.###.###good.###.###that works out real well.###.	###what would you get --n40400a.###.###uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy.
140117:51	###.###it's just, uh, too much.###that snake used --n4035db to watch our cat walk around.###i always told my wife, i says you know, your friend's going --n4036a3 to get our cat one of these days.###.###oh, my gosh.###.###.###oh, my gosh.###that is wild.	###.###oh, me neither.###.
140156:7	###.###and he'd saved up his allowance, you know, and picked him out a bird in a bird cage### and, and that stinking bird, when i brought it home tried --n404350 to take it out of the little box that they give you --n404387 --n40438e###.###.###yes.###.###clamped onto my finger and would not,###i mean, i had --n40454c to literally shake him off --n404567 to get him in the cage,###and he has tried --n404657 to bite me for two years,	###.###oh, gosh.###.
140338:11	###.###no,###okay.###.###no,###i have just retired from, um, the southwest medical center.###.###oh.###.###yeah, where there are a lot of people --n123ef down there that --n12402 could help me with my car --n12421,	###so.###.###yeah.
140466:37	### do you, do you have children.###.###just one.###.###just one.###.###yeah.###.###oh.###.	###but it ends up --n401188 giving us three bedrooms, which we wanted --n4011af.###and, uh. use an extra one for an office which --n40127e is handy.###.
140606:44	###uh-huh.###.###and, they, there was one side where our chimney was --n403c9d,###and just the chimney was going --n403d59 to be brick,###and they wanted us --n403de3 to have more brick,###so we ended up --n403e68 having --n403e73 to go halfway up###.###uh-huh.###.### which, it does look nicer,	###but, of course at that point we couldn't afford it,### and, but, it --n404113's funny that you'd say that, because there were homes --n40414a in here that --n40415d didn't have any brick at all.###.
140608:99	###and, they, there was one side where our chimney was --n403c9d,###and just the chimney was going --n403d59 to be brick,###and they wanted us --n403de3 to have more brick,###so we ended up --n403e68 having --n403e73 to go halfway up###.###uh-huh.###.### which, it does look nicer,###and, you know, we would have like --n403fb3 to have had all brick,###but, of course at that point we couldn't afford it,	###.###right.###.
140749:35	###and it comes inside.###.###have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside --n401e80.###.###uh, yeah,###we've tried that,###and, uh, you know, there's certain spots in the house where he likes --n401fe9 to go --n401ff8,###.###yeah.###.	###but, you know, that's natural for a little puppy. huh.###.###that's nothing, huh.
140781:51	###.###how old is it --n402927.###.###she'll be sixteen in may.###.###man that's sad.###.###and yeah,###.###.	###.###oh, of course not.###.
140785:21	###.###man that's sad.###.###and yeah,###.###.###but we can't bear --n402a4b to do anything because she's been our friend for all these years,###.###oh, of course not.###.	###.###i couldn't.###.
140895:8	###um,###.###uh-huh.###.###so he spends time --n4003cb doing that with him, --n4003e6 planning and, um, practicing outside.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, he's a real sports kind of person,###so he plays tennis with, with the kids.	###except the baby plays in the playground.###.###uh-huh.

142105:20	###.###my wife had, uh, just put in a bunch of, i want --n4036c4 to say, they are --n4036e3 pansies.###.###uh-huh.###.###she put them in like two months ago cause they are winter plants.###.###right.###.###and they have been,	###.###oh, they do great.###i put mine in probably in november.
142177:53	###.###yeah.###.###.###is it.###uh-huh.###.###yeah.###you know, i, uh, camped in the boy scouts###and, you know, my dad and i went out sometimes	###.###uh-huh.###.
142239:26	###and then we would go to work and uh, come back to the, uh, you know, boat house at night###and, uh, in the afternoon, you know, it is still four o'clock.###you have got four hours of day light, good skiing left.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, it was great.###.###yeah.###.	###.###uh-huh.###do you have electricity out there.
142286:128	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###i'm in construction	###.###uh-huh.###.
142370:42	###see, she shows dogs###and, uh, you can sneak a dog into a motel###.###uh-huh.###.###but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel.###.###no.###.###so, she, uh, you know, takes the motor home.	###.###uh-huh.###.
142538:14	###and it, it's just too high.###it is really scary,### but and the only thing i would consider doing, a professional, maybe doing that,###.###yeah.###.###but it###other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional.###.###well, our house in new mexico, it was stucco,	###.###yeah.###.
142573:39	###yeah.###scaffold.###.###that's it.###.###he came and did it that way###and i think he charged me a hundred dollars --n402b81 to finish up.###.###huh.###.	###.###it's,###.
142640:14	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###oh, my word.###.###and he had, he had, the, uh, he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
142644:22	###oh, my word.###.###and he had, he had, the, uh, he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that###.###uh-huh.###.###and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
142831:58	###oh, tom grieve.###.###yeah.###.###yeah.### i'm, i'm not sure that, um, that they're ready --n402dde to get rid --n402df1 of, of, uh, tom grieve yet,###but howse might be a different, uh, situation,###and i think you're probably right, that they, that they need some, you know, some changes in, uh, pitching coach, maybe###and, um,###.	###and i'm sure,###.###you do, huh.
142853:51	###.###oh, i know.###you know, it --n403684's too bad that, uh, it has --n4036af to be a forty-two year old guy --n4036d6 to, to lead the, uh, the rangers, you know.###.###i understand.###.###they need --n4038ee to have some, some young guys that --n403915 can take the lead### and, and,###uh, yeah.###.	###.###.###but i think with their new stadium, they should go and let,
143239:69	###but,###.###are you finding it --n400bc1 tough trying to find what you want --n400bec###or,###.###well, what, the problem we got --n400ce6 is that we've got five children###.###oh, boy.###.###and so, uh, we really want four or five bedroom house	###.###speakera18-1*t18-1.### r-, right.
143370:80	###.###oh, yeah.###yeah,###it is,###.###yeah.###.###mumblex.###uh, we're having,###.	###.###right.###that's, uh,
143402:93	###.###speakera76-1*t76-1.###but they always seemed --n403259 to get along fine, you know.###speakerbnan*t76-1.###speakerb76-2*t76-2.###oh, yeah,###yeah.###i think once we get into a place, it will be just fine,###speakeranan*t76-2.###.	###.###.###oh, sure.
143418:112	###i always just sort of a, assign my wife that chore,###then i would let her narrow it down to three or four,###.###then i'd go --n4038a6 look because women seem --n4038bd to like --n4038cc to look a lot more than men do.###.###.###oh, yeah.###maybe that's the case.###at least she's got more opinions, you know,###.	###.###.###yes.
143556:39	###.###uh, i think that the combination of, uh, technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn --n4013fd.###uh, i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system, uh, that --n401589 will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster.###uh, school systems are, in too many states, dominated --n40171a by administrators###.###uh-huh,###yeah.###.###and, uh, both teachers and parents, uh, complain about the, uh, uh, the cost and ineffectiveness that --n401832 results.###so my feeling is that, uh, the, the problem is, is, uh, significant. there are plenty of good people, uh, available to, uh, offer people educational experience, but that we just have --n4019eb to re-, reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it	###.###uh-huh.###.
143644:17	###uh, i have a few favorites that i use --n4002a1 more than others###and, uh, i try --n40035c to keep my balances fairly reasonable.### i, i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted --n400425 to.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when, when you start --n40055a using more than a few --n400575###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
143727:21	###speakerbnan*t38-2.###.###so,###.###speakerb42-1*t42-1.###but i know some people can get, get, you know, carried --n4017c0 away with them and let them get out of hand.###speakeranan*t42-1.###speakera42-2*t42-2.###uh-huh.###it --n401925's really easy, just to forget, you know, that you, you charged that or charged that.	###speakerbnan*t42-2.###.###but sometimes i forget
143798:45	###.###yeah,###.###i'm not even sure what their interest rate is --n402982 since i pay it off###but you know,###.###is that the one from sears.###.###uh, i think sears originally put it out,###okay.	###.###i mean, uh, i've haven't found many places that --n402ca2 don't take discover.###.
143878:66	###i think it --n403b8f's best to keep the number --n403bb2 down that you have --n403bc9.###speakerbnan*t93-1.###speakerb93-2*t93-2.###uh-huh.###speakeranan*t93-2.###.###yeah.###.###so,###.	###.###i probably wouldn't be able --n403e69 to use them.###.
143975:37	###.###uh-huh.###.### i don't think, i think that person is, is beyond, uh, rehabilitation### and, and he should be taken --n400b3d out.###.###well, i, i also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
144109:8	###they weren't dope dealers,###they weren't drug fiends,###they were employees of a, an establishment that --n4036c0 had a very high level of security sense, too.###and these were really responsible people.###.###huh.###.###you know, and they convicted this guy because somebody says, well, he looks like the right guy.###.###.	###.###yeah.###.
144229:84	###.###boy, they've had a hard time.###they said they've lost a lot of squeakers.###.###oh, man.###.###.###that,###well, yeah,###but, i mean, just this whole year has been just disastrous for them	###.###yeah.###.
144389:49	###.###well, i guess i'm not too aware of how much they're spending --n400f10 right now. you know.###.###i'm not either.###.###.###i'm definitely not aware of how much.###.###yeah.###.	###.###uh-huh,###yeah.
144467:26	###yeah.###.###uh,###.###and, knowing, you know,###.###myself, uh, uh, i'm just recently, or about --n4021c8 to, get a divorce###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah.###.
144511:73	###i think for a lot of people it has.###.###certainly.###.###so,###.###yeah.###.###so,###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
144696:37	###well, got any problems on mockingbird with crime###or is that a crime free zone there.###.###no,###i don't think there is any such thing, as a crime free zone any longer.###.###.###i'm afraid you're right.###.###uh, one evening i decided --n400276 to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought, oh, well, something's happens on mockingbird and then heard yells and screams	###.###oh, my.###.
144762:48	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###well, i was thinking, if you've been there that long, you've seen plano grow from what --n401684 was really a, a small town to a city.###.###.###yes.###.###.	###.###.###uh-huh.
144762:89	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###well, i was thinking, if you've been there that long, you've seen plano grow from what --n401684 was really a, a small town to a city.###.###.###yes.###.###.	###.###.###uh-huh.
144895:40	###speakerb92-1*t92-1.###we're over by fair park.###speakeranan*t92-1.###speakera92-2*t92-2.###oh, my goodness.###speakerbnan*t92-2.###.###and, uh, you know, you watch the people.###.###speakerb94-1*t94-1.	###speakeranan*t94-1.###speakera94-2*t94-2.###huh.
145023:44	###.###.###yeah,###they forget.###also, i think, uh, a good argument for that is in the area of politics, you know,###if a,###a woman congressman i'm sure --n402493 makes as much as a man congressman as, and the same as a senator or whatever.###.###right.###.	###but, i guess just the most significant thing changed for me, again, as i mentioned, was just in traveling,###you see, uh, more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases and, uh, and in their business suits and and going.###.
145025:31	###yeah,###they forget.###also, i think, uh, a good argument for that is in the area of politics, you know,###if a,###a woman congressman i'm sure --n402493 makes as much as a man congressman as, and the same as a senator or whatever.###.###right.###.###so, they certainly, uh, they certainly deserve it all the way.###but, i guess just the most significant thing changed for me, again, as i mentioned, was just in traveling,	###.###and going,###yeah.
145073:8	###and hers was the only income we had --n403994 for three or four months###so,###.###right.###.###you know, she certainly did her part in help --n403a9a getting me establishing in my business###and she still works everyday###so,###.###yeah,	###.###you bet.###.
145356:35	###yeah.###.###i'll tell you what,### i, i can't say a whole lot about credit cards because i, uh, tore mine up.###.###is that right.### i, i know pe-, i know some other people that --n400242 have done that.###.###yeah,###uh, i got in some problems with, uh, financial problems because of credit cards	###.###um.###.
145372:19	###.###uh-huh.###.###but,###.###uh-huh,###yeah,### i h-, i have, we have some, some friends that --n40087a did the, exactly the same thing.### they, uh, you know, they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed###and finally they realized that they were, they were abusing them and weren't going --n400aeb to get out of the hole	###and they're still paying away --n400d3e to get out of debt.###.###yeah.
145624:37	###so i told my husband, uh, you know,###what should i say --n40027d###and then he reminded me,###but, uh, uh, hi-, in his family, uh, what they usually do --n40035f, on his dad's side, his mom or, uh, the aunts will send out little postcards, like, two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the, the, where to meet --n400412 and, you know, --n40042d just, to bring anything,###and so they just notify everyone by mail,###and then they just meet at, like, a park or something --n400786 to have like a, a short, uh, or a small, uh, dinner type thing.###.###well, that sounds great, ellen.###how far away do they come from --n40098d.###.	###and they come as far as, oh, seattle### and, and sometimes we've gone###and we were f-, we were living in utah at the time.
145631:52	###well, that sounds great, ellen.###how far away do they come from --n40098d.###.###uh, they come from, well, they all meet in portland###and they come as far as, oh, seattle### and, and sometimes we've gone###and we were f-, we were living in utah at the time.###.###oh, okay.###.	###and his mom's side of the family, they all, uh, have their family reunions in southern utah###and people would come from seattle to there and, uh, let's see, nevada and in that area, washington and nevada to southern utah###and they would, uh, assign a different person, each time they had a reunion --n40107a they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody.
145632:31	###how far away do they come from --n40098d.###.###uh, they come from, well, they all meet in portland###and they come as far as, oh, seattle### and, and sometimes we've gone###and we were f-, we were living in utah at the time.###.###oh, okay.###.###and, uh, the, his, his dad's family is all around the area	###and people would come from seattle to there and, uh, let's see, nevada and in that area, washington and nevada to southern utah###and they would, uh, assign a different person, each time they had a reunion --n40107a they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody.###.
145656:57	###.###and then they just sort of do like a little program or, you know, something like that so that everyone's sort of involved --n401624.###.###yeah.###.###.###that's interesting.###you sound like you've had a lot of experience with this, then.###.###oh, well, that's my husband's side	###so we just have --n4019e4 to either or, give a formal invite###.###.
145660:11	###.###.###that's interesting.###you sound like you've had a lot of experience with this, then.###.###oh, well, that's my husband's side###and my mom, my mom's, or my family, uh, we all live in southern california###so we just have --n4019e4 to either or, give a formal invite###.###.	###so,###.###southern california's still pretty large.
145686:30	###well, my experience, uh, has been limited --n401d26 pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side###and, uh, they haven't had a reunion since then.###they just show up at funerals and weddings.###.###oh.###.	###.###wow.###.
145694:28	###oh.###.###it was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that,###.###wow.###.###but, anyway, my mother's side we had our, our first real reunion that i've ever gone to --n4020e8 last summer###and they had people come in from out of town###and they took some rooms down at a holiday inn###and, uh, they had some activity,	###and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree###and, you know, a lot of that sort of thing.###since it was the first one that we'd had --n40255b that, you could do that once.
145793:5	###.###arlington, texas.###.###arlington.###.###yes.###.###well, there's a lot of s-, stuff going on in arlington these days.###.###yes,	###.###are you involved in any of that.###.
145866:54	###oh, do you.###.### in the, in the dallas, fort worth area.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, you know, unfortunately we, we were part of a, of a bigger, bigger company###.###uh-huh.###.	### and, and i do miss that. you know,###.###yeah.
146021:63	###oh, yeah,###that's already hurting.###.###you know, that's the ones that that that's going --n404639 to hurt --n404648 because they depend on that, uh,###.###.###but i think there's a case, where benefits have gotten,###.###.###they voted them in	###.###oh, yeah.###.
146102:13	###i haven't tried any needlepoint yet.###how about you.###.###um, actually i, i'm pretty untalented.###.###oh, right.###.###i used --n400e74 to do a lot of knitting and crocheting, um,###but i, i don't know,###somehow i don't have the time anymore.	###.###.###oh, really.
146225:56	###but when i washed them --n4035d7, although i took the precaution of --n4035fa turning them inside out i really didn't do anything else. and truly, everything --n403641 fell off, or most of it.###.###oh, sure.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###oh, really.###.	###and i bought the paint and redid most of the edges###.###oh.
146357:22	###it's not really like a soap opera,###.###oh, i think,###.###.###yeah.###.### but, but it's,###but that's true,###i mean, you, you learn more about the characters and stuff,	###.###yeah,###sure.
146478:11	###.###yeah.###.###oh.###.###yeah,### they didn't, they only did it for, i think, two years.###.###oh.###.	###.###oh, another show i like --n403838 to watch --n403847 is mash.###.
146556:54	###right.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference.###and i have a a friend who --n401541 is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and has no family who, you know, --n401590 could care for her.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###and another thing to think about --n4018da, uh, on the positive side of the nursing homes here,
146574:27	###and i got --n401ac4 to see a lot of the things that they did --n401af3###.###uh-huh.###.### they, uh, they had a lot of crafts###.###yes.###.###and they had a lot of games###and, uh, they, get together and just do,	###and then there### some, some of the, uh, the people that --n401e74 are in there are real, you know, very nice and friendly to everybody###.
146612:96	###but they tend --n4026ec to behave like children, small children###.###yeah.###.###and that would be very difficult i think --n4027d1 for an adult who --n4027ec wasn't in that situation to to have --n402813 to deal with --n402826 on a daily basis.###.###yeah.###.###uh.###.	###they would just roll themselves around all over the place### and and they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities###.
146613:22	###.###yeah.###.###and that would be very difficult i think --n4027d1 for an adult who --n4027ec wasn't in that situation to to have --n402813 to deal with --n402826 on a daily basis.###.###yeah.###.###uh.###.###well, it is like, wel-, the one that i worked in --n4029eb, uh, you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day,	### and and they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities###.###yes.
146718:42	###right,###uh-huh.###and i think it is going --n401a0f to come to that because some people will just not go to the,### it's, it --n401b2e's trouble for me to do what i do --n401b59###.###yeah.###.###i mean, i am willing --n401c5e to do it###but,###.	###.###yeah.###.
146946:16	###it --n10f21 might kill you to go up and, walk up to the door###.###that's right.###.###but you're going --n11046 to look nice for the kids.###.###that's right###and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids, right.###.###oh, oh, yeah.	###.###yeah,###i do too.
147073:10	###yeah, well,###.###for,###.###i know that some of the schools they have, uh, country western day or something like that one, you know, or tacky day,###and i always thought it was kind of out of, got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too --n1387c.###.###yeah,###really.###.	###they look tacky a lot###but i didn't think teachers should, you know.###.
147218:86	### and, uh, so yeah,###we can comment###and we didn't see this a few years ago.###.###no,###and i think,###.###it was pretty clear here.###.###yeah,	###.###right.###.
147272:53	###she'll be a hundred and three in august.###.###uh-huh.###.###and we decide --n4003ee not to put her in a nursing home.###she lives with my mother and my father who --n4004a6 also live here in town###and then my sister takes care of her.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###.
147309:60	###there's seven children in my husband's family###and fortunately four of them live in the same home town###and she has alzheimer's.###it was getting where she was getting th-, dangerous. i mean letting strangers in and things like this --n401053,###.###uh-huh.###.###but they were very fortunate.###it's a small town###and she happens --n40120c to room with one of the doctor's mothers	###.###oh, well that's good.###.
147359:22	### i, i know a lady that --n402323 lives in a place similar to that in austin.###.###and allows,###.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah.###well, the only problem with these are that they are very expensive.	###but,###.###and the bad thing about it, before you can get any kind of government help, you just practically have, well you have --n402654 to be a pauper.
147490:11	###and i don't like --n40087a to see women, you know, like waiting on men hand and foot###.###right.###.###but, you know, i, i believe in like sharing and doing things for each other.###.###i do too.###i like the idea.###i see a lot more, uh,###my children, i have five children	###.###uh-huh.###.
147529:33	###yeah.###so.###.###i've always taught my men that.###they better clean up with their women and help them.###if they did that, you know.###.###right.###.###and they're, they're good about it.	###and a big thing that i see --n401669. all that, most of the, most of the women getting married --n4016c4 now, uh, go back, have gone back to, you know,###.###uh-huh.
147578:50	###.###oh, me too.###.###they're moving them up###and they're sharp###and they,###so you're going --n4022e6 to see a lot, a lot more of that in leadership i believe --n402329.###.###yeah.###i like --n402443 to see that.	###.###uh-huh. right.###.
147599:45	###.###yes.###.###so.###.###yeah.###but they wouldn't know what they're doing --n402920.###.###right.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
147632:32	###so that's, i think that's good. to keep the equal as far as, as, uh, not, nex-, nex-, uh, necessarily by sex type thing. you know.###.###right.###same here.###.###you should be able --n4032c2 to accomplish as much.###and i think the, uh, attitude --n403361 is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah.###.
147671:18	###.###i'm,###.### i'm real dis-, i'm kind of disgusted this year because i don't see many women into the political scene###and i really think we should have more political leaders --n403cc0 --n403cc7 in the women than we do up for, and even for president and vice president this year,###.###oh, yeah.###i agree with that.###.###there's nobody again.	###oh, what was the lady's name that --n404027 ran a couple of --n40403e,###fitz-,###i forget her name now.
147812:60	###it --n4021c4's so easy to blame them to mumblex###a lot of times i think it's our own fault.###they lie to us because we don't want --n40233b to hear the truth.###.###yeah,###they say you, get the government you deserve --n402429.###.###and it,###.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
147854:89	### tex-, tarrant county junior college.###.###oh.###.###yeah.###.###okay.###.###and it's really, it's really enjoyable.###i like it.	###and i don't think we can make laws --n4034ff to eliminate anything anyplace totally.###.###you can make laws against corruption.
147877:42	###.###well, they've got laws against cannib-, cannibalism###but that didn't stop that guy in, milwaukee, did it.###.###no,### sure didn't, did it.###.###.###so no,###i think you can legislate	###and we would end up with so many more laws that, you know,###i mean i just think that's human nature that you're going --n403d40 to have corruption in government, in business, personal life, i mean, you know.###.
147951:70	###uh-huh.###.###and so we have quite a collection of those,###and you watch them at home,###and they have subtitles,###so you, you figure out what --n400fe7's going on after a while,###and then you can enjoy it in the, uh, theater.###.###oh.###.	###.###what is that --n4012dc.###.
148012:35	###.###yes mumblex.###.###well, you've got half a string quartet there.###.###yeah.###we're on our way.###.###yeah.###.	###.###well, since you seem --n40224f to like, uh, italian music, have you ever, uh, gotten into gabrielli or anybody there in that era, the, uh, period right before, actually before vivaldi, i guess.###.
148080:55	###.###and they will, uh, record the music at that time.###and so, uh, it is, uh, uh, high quality grade music,###and, of course, now they're getting, they also have a jazz section,###and they also have a, uh, more contemporary and american uh, composer section.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###well, i had go-, heard good things about the, uh, music heritage society,	###.###yeah.###.
148159:32	###.###.###uh-huh.###so would this vacation you're taking --n10cd8,###did you receive information from your skiing magazine.###.###probably not.###uh, we already knew we wanted --n10dfd to take one,###and we just started --n10ea5 looking around.###i may have referred to a couple of them,	###.###oh.###.
148216:17	###.###.###does it have, uh, articles on how to do things --n11b83 as well as equipment that you can buy --n11baa and so forth.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh,### they do have, uh, mostly they have, uh, the ads on the equipment,###but the whole magazine is just filled --n11e03 with, uh, pictures and projects that you can make --n11e36 yourself,	###and so, it's really a fun one.###i like that.###.
148359:23	###.###that's exactly me.###the acid rock or the heavy metal.###.###yeah.###.###even some of that i like --n4007a3 okay but not, mostly, as a general rule,###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah.###i don't enjoy rap too much, either.
148424:40	###yeah,###sure.###.###so, they're interesting to listen to --n4014c5.###you might try that.###how about you.###.###well, um, i listen to, uh, specific,### most, most likely i would be listen to, uh, jazz or classical music.###um, i, in college i took, uh, four years of classical guitar,	###i play guitar for the jazz combo.###.###oh, yeah.
148457:84	###.###uh-huh.###.###um, i wouldn't have admitted it when i was in high school --n40224f###but, i really do like it a lot.###.###.###so.###.### i, i like some of it, um,	###.###no,###it doesn't,
148466:14	### i, i like some of it, um,###as far as like the cou-, what they now call --n402446 country western, it doesn't sound like the old country music at all, does it.###.###no,###it doesn't,###it doesn't.###.###um, some of it sounds more like pop music.###.###yeah,	###.###oh, n-,###yeah,
148562:19	###i like his,###he has a nice smooth voice.###.###oh, yeah,###and, you know, what --n4038cf i like --n4038de the most about him, is, i've gone --n40390d to see him in concert, and he always, he looks like he's having fun.###.###yeah,###sure.###.###i mean, some people sing,	###.###.###but he looks like he's having a good time.
148566:77	###and, you know, what --n4038cf i like --n4038de the most about him, is, i've gone --n40390d to see him in concert, and he always, he looks like he's having fun.###.###yeah,###sure.###.###i mean, some people sing,###and they have their faced all contorted, like it hurts them or something.###.###.###but he looks like he's having a good time.	###.###uh-huh.###.
148841:63	###.###okay,###so this is my first one.###you're probably a veteran at this.###.###yeah.###.###.###well, it has, it has been really fun.###i've enjoyed this.	###.###uh-huh.###.

149121:55	###and the teacher just tries to, tries --n401fa6 to teach english, you know, through natural understanding.###.### that's, uh, exactly what, yeah, that's the kind of thing i'm working with --n402105 exactly.###.###uh-huh.###.###you seem --n402235 to be, uh, better informed --n402258 than the average person on that.###.###well, it was just, uh, when i was high school --n402349, i worked for the community school,###and they had a english second language class	###.###uh-huh.###.
149121:134	###and the teacher just tries to, tries --n401fa6 to teach english, you know, through natural understanding.###.### that's, uh, exactly what, yeah, that's the kind of thing i'm working with --n402105 exactly.###.###uh-huh.###.###you seem --n402235 to be, uh, better informed --n402258 than the average person on that.###.###well, it was just, uh, when i was high school --n402349, i worked for the community school,###and they had a english second language class	###.###uh-huh.###.
149185:86	###.###yeah.###.###and you know, then, then we, then i started --n403ab7 playing with apples, you know,###and those had forty-eight,###or, you know, if they were really great they had sixty-four k.###.###oh, the old the old apple, uh, the, the original apple had, what, yeah, forty-eight i guess --n403d5c, didn't it.###.###.	###.###.###and
149313:57	###.###yeah.###.###he meows and wants --n40130e to get in the bathroom###and, while he showers, it's so hilarious.###so he's quite a animal.###.###yeah,###boy,###i guess.	###.###yeah.###.
149355:26	###well, do you live, you, you in a house, or a place where you, uh,###.###yes,###uh-huh,###we're in a house,###but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog --n402141,###.###i see.###.###we couldn't allow him to run free,	###and it was, it was unfortunate.###.###sure.
149461:11	###uh-huh.###.###and we really love it out here.###it's, uh, kind of country.### we're, we're only about ten minutes from ogden.###.###uh-huh.###.###so, we're kind of --n403b22 country but not too.###.	###.###no,###huh-uh.
149698:8	###.###or you know, it doesn't seem that it's going --n40516b to make much of a difference.###.###uh-huh.###it,###i mean, i don't know,### i i don't, i don't think george bush will make the american people happy with ninety-seven cents a week.###.###no,###no,	###.###i just don't think it was a well thought out incentive.###.
149818:30	### don't, don't walk down a, an alley###or don't get###.###yeah.###.### just try --n4027be to keep yourself out of a bad situation###.###uh-huh.###.###but, yeah,	###.###uh.###.
149918:12	###.###so i got it back.###.###well, you're probably luckier than.###.###yeah,###than most.###.###uh-huh.###um, so like does insurance pay for the body damage,	###.###right.###.
149951:38	###.###so. how's your products been --n40002e.###.###um, i really haven't had, uh, too many problems.###uh, seems to me that everything that i buy --n40014e goes bad just after the warranty runs out.###.###i hear that one.###have you had any lately go out.###.###yeah,	###and they,###unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time, when i bought my new house --n400438,###and, uh, i really don't have any recourse,
149953:17	###.###um, i really haven't had, uh, too many problems.###uh, seems to me that everything that i buy --n40014e goes bad just after the warranty runs out.###.###i hear that one.###have you had any lately go out.###.###yeah,###i've had a dryer, an ice maker, a microwave, all three,###and they,	###and, uh, i really don't have any recourse,###so i had --n400578 to call and have them all repaired --n40059b and that.###.
149955:33	###uh, seems to me that everything that i buy --n40014e goes bad just after the warranty runs out.###.###i hear that one.###have you had any lately go out.###.###yeah,###i've had a dryer, an ice maker, a microwave, all three,###and they,###unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time, when i bought my new house --n400438,###and, uh, i really don't have any recourse,	###.###oh, wow.###.
149963:22	###unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time, when i bought my new house --n400438,###and, uh, i really don't have any recourse,###so i had --n400578 to call and have them all repaired --n40059b and that.###.###oh, wow.###.###yeah,###it was a hassle.###.###so you didn't get anything,	###.###yeah,###the warranty on the refrigerator, uh,
149978:22	###the refrigerator warranty's still good,###but the ice maker itself, passed its three years,###and it was three years and two months.###.###you're kidding.###.###no.###.###yeah,###we just moved into a new house, too,	###.###uh, watch out.###.
149989:47	###.###uh, watch out.###.###yeah,###the only thing i've had problems with --n400b8d is, um,###i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail###.###uh-huh.###.###and i bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such --n400d0b,	###so.###.###um.
150001:27	###.###um.###.###i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than,###i just ended up --n400fad using it.###but, that's about the only thing i've had --n401044 gone wrong.###but.###.###i usually have pretty good luck with appliances,###but i just, uh,	###and the the ice maker was, uh, had --n4012db to have a new pump,###.###that's incredible.
150011:41	###it --n4011d0 was within two days that all three of these stopped --n4011ff working,###and the the ice maker was, uh, had --n4012db to have a new pump,###.###that's incredible.###.###and the, uh, microwave had --n40140d to have, uh, some kind of something i can't even pronounce --n401450,###.###.###and they, uh,###the dryer had --n40157b to have a new heating element,	###.###and they all went out at the same time.###.
150013:10	###.###that's incredible.###.###and the, uh, microwave had --n40140d to have, uh, some kind of something i can't even pronounce --n401450,###.###.###and they, uh,###the dryer had --n40157b to have a new heating element,###so it was about, almost three hundred dollars for all three of them.###.	###.###uh, within two days of each other.###.
150025:42	###uh, within two days of each other.###.###or two days.###wow.###.###i was,###it wasn't a good week.###i was pretty mad.###.###.	###so even if i, i think even if i had, uh, had kept the warranty, the service agreements were with the companies that, that --n401a58 manufactured,###but still they were through that retailer,###so i don't know if i could have taken it to another retailer or not.
150033:30	###.###.### and plus the place that i'd bought them all --n4018e3 had gone out of business,###so even if i, i think even if i had, uh, had kept the warranty, the service agreements were with the companies that, that --n401a58 manufactured,###but still they were through that retailer,###so i don't know if i could have taken it to another retailer or not.###.###wow,###it's frustrating.###.	###.###.###so. it was a call to the local appliance dealer who --n401e86 came out and fixed them all,
150036:57	###so even if i, i think even if i had, uh, had kept the warranty, the service agreements were with the companies that, that --n401a58 manufactured,###but still they were through that retailer,###so i don't know if i could have taken it to another retailer or not.###.###wow,###it's frustrating.###.###but i didn't have --n401d7c to worry about all that, because they weren't under warranty.###.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
150102:13	###so.###.###well, that's something i've never had --n4031ba to use --n4031c9,### it's never, i've never been involved --n403297 in an automobile accident,###so, luckily that's a product that i haven't had --n403384 to test --n403393.###.###yeah.###.###but i think it's a great idea.### i'm, i'm,	###but that.###.###well, they do the, all the testing that we have --n403660 to do --n40366f through the government,
150105:28	### it's never, i've never been involved --n403297 in an automobile accident,###so, luckily that's a product that i haven't had --n403384 to test --n403393.###.###yeah.###.###but i think it's a great idea.### i'm, i'm,### seems like all the good logical ideas take forever --n403574 to come about###but that.###.	###it --n40375f's incredible how much testing they have --n403782 to do --n403791.###.###oh, i'm sure they want --n403852 to be thorough before they.
150206:178	###.###and, uh, at that time i immediately joined the h m o,###and i never really,###so the only doctor i, i've kind of consistently had --n401cee has been through the h m o,###and, uh you know, for me it's worked out real good.###.###yeah.###.###.###right,	###and you feel comfortable with it.###.###uh-huh.
150225:9	###uh-huh.###.###but your benefits are not as, you know, good,###so, uh.###.###uh-huh.###yeah,###um, like you, you mentioned you work for a school system.###i work for, uh, georgia tech in the research branch,###.	###.###and i guess another one that, that i rank --n402797 up there high is the, uh, kind of job flexibility and time off, um, i enjoy --n4027f2 as a benefit.###.
150247:49	###yeah,### getting a lot of breaks between quarters and that, and having a lot of vacation.###.###right.###.###.### it, it really, um,###i don't think most of our teachers,###now i'm not a teacher,###i am a secretarial executive assistant,	###.###uh-huh.###.
150254:6	###i don't think most of our teachers,###now i'm not a teacher,###i am a secretarial executive assistant,###but i don't think the teachers could stand the stress all, all year long frankly.###.###uh-huh.###.###it is just, texas has really, um, you know,###they want everybody educated --n402f12, no matter what it costs --n402f31,###uh, and it, it would be just,	###like in two weeks we have spring break,###and i don't know who --n403131 looks forward to it more, the students or the teachers and the staff.###.
150288:17	###right.###.###and, um, it --n40394a's good that they allow you that.###.###right.###.###it, um,###as i say, the schools,###now we do have --n403ab0 to work, you know, the day,###but we do get many days off,	###.###uh-huh.###.
150354:22	### it's it's kind of kept me from --n400b9d getting cabin fever and, um, has seemed --n400bc8 to be a real nice aerobic exercise.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###do you do, uh, any anaerobic type, weight lifting or weight training type exercise.###.###no,###huh-uh.	###i'm about fifty pounds overweight,###and so i'd like --n400f5a to get the weight off,###and then i'd really like --n400ffd to get into that.
150658:81	###i used --n402d09 to read every month a reader's digest###.###uh-huh.###.###but, um, now i guess i just have friends that --n402de7 clip articles###or if i, you know, am interested in something,###of course, during the w-, when we were in war --n402f67, i read up on that just a little in the newspaper --n402f9e to find out what --n402fb5 was going on.###.###oh, yeah.###.	###but i just can't seem --n40331f to find the time.###.###yeah.
150678:44	###but,###.###well, i remember back during the, uh, during the war, everyone here at work always had the radio or the t v on, because that, they were going constantly with that stuff.###.###right.###.###but, uh.###.###well, i, um, they even did a story --n403896 on our news here in texas on what people wanted --n4038c5 to see more of --n4038dc,###and people said that they wanted --n403a31 to see more on outside of texas news.	###.###yeah.###.
150865:20	###i mean, did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, uh, sort of a moderator role in the trial###or,###.###yeah,### they, well they picked one person,###and then he finally, you know, moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have --n402d77.###.###so it work-, it did end up --n402e8c working out pretty well.###.###yeah,	###.###the one thing i sometimes wonder about --n402ff1, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like pro-, product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision --n4030a4 to be made --n4030b7 sometimes --n4030c2###.
150915:70	###.### so, and they are, it was a double wide,###so they'd already taken it apart.###.###uh.###.###so they left it there###.###yeah.###.	###.###uh.###.
150993:13	###.###.###um.###.###course they don't have --n4013cb to give a reason,###but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like, you know,###.###no.###.###they want --n401546 to get the best, uh, mix for their case,	###.### that that's a science in itself.###.
151057:41	### i ju-, i, i don't know,### i, uh, i didn't, uh, uh, i didn't like --n402a95 not being able --n402aa8 to deliberate.###.###right.###.### i, uh, i, i wanted --n402c03 to vote guilty for the guy,###and the other people were kind of mixed###.###uh-huh.###.	### cost him a lot of money,###i'm sure.###.
151113:5	###and we had --n40408d to acquit him in both cases.###.###uh, it was too circumstantial.###.###uh, yeah,###it was, yeah, in some of the critical things, like the off-, special investigations, at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person,###but something happened to the camera and the tape and###.###um.###.	###.###.###pretty good,
151191:11	###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###and we work around a lot of explosives.###.###well, that sounds like kind of an important job to be, uh, straight on --n4013b0.###.###yeah,###so that's, you know,	###and so they could blow up the whole,###well, they have safety features with each of the explosives they use --n401746,###but still, it can be dangerous.
151229:4	###uh-huh.###.###but if they catch you, if you test positive for a, a controlled substance, then you get fired --n40245f.###.###oh, wow.###.###so, it, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos.###.###huh, that's.###i think our policy is that,	###i'm not really sure what the,###.###yeah,
151426:78	###.###and also i just think it, it gets a lot,###i'm a big, uh, supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies,###and i think that it just moves down along a line that, that i really would find --n403b69 bad if, if most people went down that line into --n403b9c regulating employees' lives outside of work, you know,###there's already talk of people,###well, we're not going --n403e26 to hire you if you smoke.###.###mumblex.###.###well, you know, i, i can see how they can say in the work place we, you don't want them to smoke --n403f60,	###.###well, do you think it --n40423d's, should be illegal for an employer to do this###or,
151431:148	###well, we're not going --n403e26 to hire you if you smoke.###.###mumblex.###.###well, you know, i, i can see how they can say in the work place we, you don't want them to smoke --n403f60,###but when somebody leaves work --n4040cf, i don't think that it --n4040f2's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all.###.###well, do you think it --n40423d's, should be illegal for an employer to do this###or,###.	###.###yeah.###.
151500:25	###so i, i kind of know how to do these things --n400839.###.###oh.###.###i used --n400908 to, you know.###.###all this planning and, and getting together and such.###um, oh, let's see what else.###.###usually when we have kind of our family reunion --n400af4 it's my grandmother's birthday,	### she, she comes from a big family.###.###uh-huh.
151509:20	###usually when we have kind of our family reunion --n400af4 it's my grandmother's birthday,### and and it's all of like,### she, she comes from a big family.###.###uh-huh.###.###she has like seven sisters i think --n400cee.###.###oh, boy.###.	###and then all,###she has, uh,###i have like, uh,
151510:9	### and and it's all of like,### she, she comes from a big family.###.###uh-huh.###.###she has like seven sisters i think --n400cee.###.###oh, boy.###.###they --n400d91 show up and all their kids.	###she has, uh,###i have like, uh,### let's see,
151515:22	###she has like seven sisters i think --n400cee.###.###oh, boy.###.###they --n400d91 show up and all their kids.###and then all,###she has, uh,###i have like, uh,### let's see,###she has four sons and two daughters,	###.###uh-huh.###.
151610:22	###and so that was a real challenge,###and i was president of our family reunion for two years,###and i wasn't very mumblex at that duty, for two years in a row,###but i found that advance planning was the key to success.###.###uh, also one thing that --n4028d8's helpful,###and i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever###.###uh-huh.###.	###so,###.###oh, that's wonderful, though.
151625:109	###but it's just kind of like get on the telephone###and, it's so and such days from such and such date###.###.###oh.###.###and everybody just shows up.###.###oh, well, that is, that is helpful.###yeah,	###.###i would say you're spread out, then.###.
151633:36	###oh, well, that is, that is helpful.###yeah,###our family ranges from, oh, goodness, well, australia, i have a brother lives in australia, to, uh, boise, idaho, and, and, uh, all kinds of places.###.###i would say you're spread out, then.###.###we are.###.###uh, my immediate family, you know, my, my parents and my brothers and sisters, i guess we're the ones that --n4030ce have the gypsy blood or whatever,###because my dad was in the army	###.###oh.###.
151716:227	###.###yeah.###.###and that's got me very, you know, highly concerned that, uh, that's going --n401195 to be quite a while before we can, uh, undo this.###.###.###now, that could spawn several good industries and help, --n401320 pull us out of this recession,###.###.###but you got --n4013e8 to have people that --n4013ff can make, you know, earn a salary --n40142e to pay for this conversion --n401449.	###.###oh, yeah.###.
151819:42	###yeah,###you do.###um, now do you have a lot mountains,###well, you don't have mountains in texas, do you.###where do you find places to camp --n4005e1 --n4005e8.###.###well, uh, we, we do a lot of canoeing when we go --n4006b3 camping --n4006be###.###oh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
151946:23	###so of course we don't, uh, want --n402cb3 to go --n402cc2 hunting.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###but we got --n402d81 to see a lot of deer um, out and about###.###oh.###.###and there's,	###and, uh, one thing that --n402f26 is a big concern in the evening, at night, uh, is, uh, make sure that all the food's put --n402f95 away and so forth because, uh, we have, uh, armadillos.###.###oh.
151947:83	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###but we got --n402d81 to see a lot of deer um, out and about###.###oh.###.###and there's,###of course, we see smaller animals all the time,	###.###oh.###.
151970:70	###uh-huh.###.###and possums, and, uh, raccoons.###.###my word.###.###and we have those creatures --n403364 down here that they like --n40337f to, uh, --n403396 they like --n4033a5 to go --n4033b4 hunting for a midnight snack.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###but they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything.###.
152098:42	###yeah,###i don't know if you saw on twenty twenty the other night, they, uh, they basically reviewed oregon's plan or the oregon plan toward, uh, nationalizing health care and that kind of thing.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###it's kind of an interesting plan.###it's kind of cold though.	###.###oh, yeah.###.
152171:36	###uh, yes,###it is.###.###the benefits plan is different for operating, for what we call --n40387c operating staff, which --n403893 are considered --n4038a2 to be, uh, clerical personnel, accountants, things like that as opposed to what they call --n4038f5 the p a t staff, which i belong to --n403924###.###.###right.###.###uh-huh.###but the main,	###.###but the main difference is in the, uh, the way sick time is accrued --n403d1b and vacation time is accrued --n403d36 --n403d3d.###.
152327:80	###.###so we,###.###yeah.###i think that's one of the things too.###you get too many management people, you know.###.###it's very easy.###.###yeah	###.###yeah.###.
152427:12	###uh-huh.###that's a concern of mine.###uh, i would feel more comfortable --n400766 in many cases i think --n400785 with judges. uh, you know, doing the sentencing.###.###uh-huh.### the other thing, the only thing that --n4008e3 really bothers me about that is i think you know, that a judge can be### i, i like the idea of juries of your peers uh, in that you, you, you get more personally more than one person making the, making a decision.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah,###my question i guess are they really your peers.
152511:27	###.###isn't that the truth.###.###uh-huh.###.###there are times when######is it, uh,###oh goodness, my mind has gone blank###it's, uh, othello.	###.###.###every now and then one is tempted --n4029a3 --n4029aa to see what, what.
152658:29	###i,### don't seem like they are doing much with it,###mumblex i mean there's plans there###and now that they are voting and people, you know, getting into mumblex drug and that stuff.###.###uh-huh.###.###they have nice plans### and, uh, but, they don't always work###and then you know they try --n401fbe to raise taxes more	###but taxes get raise --n40218b###so. i don't know.###i'm not really into politics, uh
152692:16	###uh-huh.###.###those who --n4029ea made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes,###and then there would be a set amount for however many people, you know, dependent you have --n402ae7,###and you would just pay a flat tax. no exemptions, no deductions or anything else after you know, after you figure up who --n402c32's in your family.###.###right.###huh.###.###and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the i r s	###.###yeah.###the could be nice.
152705:41	###the could be nice.###.###yeah.###.###huh.###.### i, i'd like --n402fdd to see something like that.###i think it would be fairer###and it would put a, you know, a lot of the tax attorneys our of business###and i am sure they will fight it tooth and nail,	###.###right,###yeah.
152740:16	###uh,###.### what is, do you know what your state income tax rate is --n403a90.###.###um, no###.###twenty percent.###.### i, i have no idea,###i just.	###.### just, you just pay it, huh.###.
152792:37	###.###yeah,###i usually tend --n400730 to just, you know, rely on, you know, t v, uh, again, you know, just through the grapevine just, just to know like, you know like what today's stories are --n4007db###and i usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know i'm interested in any particular one.###.###yeah.###the radio doesn't really have much news sometimes.###the stations i listen to --n400b66 are just mainly music.###.###yeah,	###.###yeah.###do you think that t v is, uh, pretty accurate.
152792:60	###.###yeah,###i usually tend --n400730 to just, you know, rely on, you know, t v, uh, again, you know, just through the grapevine just, just to know like, you know like what today's stories are --n4007db###and i usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know i'm interested in any particular one.###.###yeah.###the radio doesn't really have much news sometimes.###the stations i listen to --n400b66 are just mainly music.###.###yeah,	###.###yeah.###do you think that t v is, uh, pretty accurate.
152941:32	###but it just seemed like, you know.###.###they kept --n403a0f just showing, you know, how great we were doing --n403a42###and it never really showed what --n403b00 actually the damage that --n403b17 really happened that --n403b2a's###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
152941:93	###but it just seemed like, you know.###.###they kept --n403a0f just showing, you know, how great we were doing --n403a42###and it never really showed what --n403b00 actually the damage that --n403b17 really happened that --n403b2a's###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
153002:25	###and he'll jump on his lap,###but if anybody reaches over --n4008e3 to pet him or whatever, he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing --n400932.###.###did he raise him or something.###.### he's, he, we bought the cat for him###and so he's, uh, been the one that you know --n400b9f spent the most time with him.###.###.###but i, i've never owned a cat like that.	###and you know they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody.###.###uh-huh.
153026:45	###well, we, we named it hooper because that's where we got it from --n40103d.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, some lady, she, uh,###a lot of people, uh, uh, drop off abandoned, abandoned pets at her house###.###oh.###.###and she use --n4012b7 to work for a veter-, veterinarian	###.###uh-huh.###.
153181:13	###.###.###how do you feel --n400022 about gun control.###.###well, uh, i mean i don't think that guns should be outlawed --n4000c6###.###um.###.###but it's going --n400193 to,###a lot of the stuff that,	###and then like with the stuff of that massacre in killeen, texas not too long ago,###but i don't really know, i mean, unless they do, uh, just outlaw them, how you can, uh, prevent that --n400467.###.
153232:24	###.###well, i mean, i mean i don't really know what they can, how they can really enforce the laws any better --n401763###.###uh-huh.###.###because i mean i do think that some people need them and, like, for protection and stuff###.###uh-huh.###.###and i can understand them wanting --n4019eb to have them,	###.###well, you know, uh, uh, no-,###if you are looking at like you know country that, uh, where they do have a lot more gun control --n401bef, like england and places like that, you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much.
153534:76	###that's right.###yeah,###mine's, uh, seven years old###and i think last year was, that was a rough year for it.###i had a number of expenses.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, i am hoping that most of them were just kind of, uh, you know###the,	###so, i just went through that whole set last year.###.###uh-huh.
153542:121	###but, uh, i am hoping that most of them were just kind of, uh, you know###the,###as you get to a certain number of miles, you have --n40437a to get everything --n40438d replaced, --n40439c brakes, shocks and all that.###so, i just went through that whole set last year.###.###uh-huh.###.###i hope that i only have a slow period before i do that again.###.###those things can really upset your budget when they, when they come in --n404651.	###.###right.###.
153571:63	###well, i have a hard time thinking that they can control guns. personally.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###that's true.###.###i mean,###.	###.###that's right.###that's right.
153603:49	###i'm originally from colorado,###but yeah###.###oh well..###.### there, uh, there, uh there's a lot of hunters here.###.###yeah,###well i know how you feel --n400b44.### i'm, uh, i grew up in nebraska	###and man, there's no way. there's no way i would ever go for a total ban on all weapons --n400dc0.###.###uh-huh.
153604:77	###but yeah###.###oh well..###.### there, uh, there, uh there's a lot of hunters here.###.###yeah,###well i know how you feel --n400b44.### i'm, uh, i grew up in nebraska### and, and we always use --n400c6a to go out and hunt all the time, you know	###.###uh-huh.###.
153624:12	###.###i mean,###.###it doesn't sit with me very well.###i don't know, i, anymore###i keep a thirty-eight in my truck, you know.###.###really.###.###yeah,	###well i live in minneapolis###and i,###well actually i live in florida,
153924:12	###yeah.###well you won't offend me.###so go ahead and say.###.###.###yeah.###like a liberal type of bias.###.###yeah.###absolutely.	###people who --n402348 are journalist who --n40235b are trained --n40236a to write###and they're, that's a liberal, uh, a liberal field at least from academia###.
154067:52	###yeah.###all allocated --n401001 out..###.###yeah.###.###yeah.###.###yeah.###every penny is ear marked --n4010ac###but, uh it, we have found that works the best	###in fact, we found it --n4012dc easier to divide the major bills up, you know, cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half,### but and divide those up between all,###uh-huh.
154069:32	###.###yeah.###.###yeah.###.###yeah.###every penny is ear marked --n4010ac###but, uh it, we have found that works the best### and and so if we can just divide them up, all the major bills up.###in fact, we found it --n4012dc easier to divide the major bills up, you know, cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half,	###uh-huh.###.###all the checks,
154105:44	###.###yeah.###.###so,###.###well, it helps you to focus where your money goes --n401e03###.###yeah###.### and and i am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget,	###and then you're saying, my word where did all that money go --n402147.###.###that's a lot of money,
154106:32	###yeah.###.###so,###.###well, it helps you to focus where your money goes --n401e03###.###yeah###.### and and i am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget,###but you're wondering my, when you put down all the money that you do bring --n402018 in --n402023	###.###that's a lot of money,###but,
154160:120	###yeah.### that that sounds like a really good idea.###.###.###so.###.###and it really helpful.###uh, have you developed a savings plan or i r a s or anything like that yet.###.### we, we haven't.	###.###oh, uh-huh.###.
154463:17	###they just,###i don't know if you saw the tour posters of the rolling stones when they last toured --n403573,###but it looked like leather day at the geriatric,###.###.###mumblex.###.###yeah,###i mean cause they just,###.	###.###uh-huh.###yuck looking, i mean
154476:49	###yuck looking, i mean###.###uh-huh.###.###uh.###.###i mean it just just looked like they, got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans.###.###.###uh-huh.	###.###well,###uh,
154476:60	###yuck looking, i mean###.###uh-huh.###.###uh.###.###i mean it just just looked like they, got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans.###.###.###uh-huh.	###.###well,###uh,
154537:57	###right.###so, what what is the e p a recommending --n40055a now.###.###oh, they really didn't propose any solutions.###actually, they were, the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing --n4006ab even though he was from the e p a.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, he had a lot of, uh, facts to, to give --n400846 and, uh, things like how many solid waste plants --n400879 were being shut --n40088c down### and, and, uh, one of the most interesting things that he was talking about --n400a37 was recycling of, of news print.	###.###yeah.###.
154548:23	###.###yeah.###.###and they could sell it for a while.###they were able --n400d29 to sell it for some amount per ton###and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling --n400e06, they've collected so much news print that they have --n400e39 to pay --n400e48 to have it hauled --n400e5f away.###.###right.### that's a, that's a common problem though.### that it seems, that has happened in dallas as well as new york	###and after a while i just quit --n401279 taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore which --n4012ac isn't good for business on the other end either, i suppose --n4012eb.###.###yeah.
154570:54	###.###and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside.###.###well, that's good.###.###so one of the real keys, it sounds like --n401a55, to getting recycling for, uh, paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it.###.###right.###there has --n401cb9 to be, uh, a reuse for it.###i mean, that's why they recycle --n401d7d.	###.###uh-huh.###.
154648:13	###.###.###kay.###.###okay.###.###i guess we're talking about exercise, huh.###.###yeah,###yeah.	###.###oh, i am twenty-seven.###.
154673:50	###.###well, i do, uh, jazzercise which --n4005d4 is an aerobic, uh, program that,###.###oh you do.###.###are you familiar with it.###.###yes.###.###it's, uh, you know, a national company	###so you can,###.###are they different from aerobics
154771:14	###i just shoot around by myself.###.###yeah.###.###and, uh, that's about it.###i use --n40227d to play soccer a lot in high school,###but when i graduated --n402324 i haven't done much.###i don't have a problem.###i know i have --n402415 to do more aerobics,###but i don't have a problem with weight.	###.###well see, that's, that's th-, really good###and i think that keeps a lot, some people from --n4026b2 exercising.
154849:33	###yeah,###a lot of people do that###.###yeah.###.### and but, well i just i never find the time.###i had rather do other things.###.###yeah.###well, i have never skied before,	###and they think it's really###.###oh they come up here.
154926:28	###my legs really, really ache.###.###yeah.###yeah.###.###but, that's,###i am using muscles that i have never used --n404d52 before.###.###well,###and it --n404e0b's strange that you can do,	###and then i went horseback riding###and still i was so sore###and i couldn't get over,
154990:95	###.###oh. okay.###.###generally the, uh, the handicapped group takes care of the things that###actually, the government has placed the deposit which --n401b8b is the inducement to re-, recycle the bottle so that you get your money back###and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit### and then i, and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that --n401e19 do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well.###.###that's very cool.###you know there's a, i heard about a similar program in new york city where, uh, a thing called like homeless incorporated or something like that,	### and and i think it's mostly cans.###there may be bottles as well,###but like beer cans, soda cans and what not
155012:21	###yeah.###.###but, uh, we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people --n402ac2.###we certainly have a fair number of people that --n402bae are on welfa-, welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing.###uh, there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although, uh, scouts and hockey teams and ball teams, those kinds, uh, regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes --n402db2.###.###do they do it with news papers as well.###.###they have done it some, uh,###but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers.	###there are several containers where the group called cosmopolitan industries collects --n4031f3###or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins###and then the bins are collected --n403343.
155039:27	###but i decided that the amount of information that --n400494 would have --n4004a3 to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date.###.###uh-huh.###.###so i, i kind of gave up on the idea of --n400663 using quicken, at least for now.###.###um. i've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced --n4007a6 --n4007ad actually because what --n4007c0 will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then, well, uh, uh, not bother --n40081f to total it###.###uh-huh.###.	###so it really helps with that.###.###yeah,
155621:8	###.###and then that way everybody would have a three day holiday, okay.###and that way that more, that would make a bigger market.###we'd have, uh, more recreation.###people would have time to do it --n400fda.###there would be less of a stress level.### we'd have, we'd have less crime.### we'd have to we'd have --n401198 to build less prisons, you know, less police force.###.###yeah,	###although, there may be more crime. i mean if people have more leisure time.###it's not clear.###and that,
155650:9	###right.###.###it's called --n401d41 a a group,### well what --n401dcf will, well what --n401de6 happens then is that they cancel, because they just can't cancel an individual.###so they, they have --n401f4c to cancel just like life insurance.###they have --n402001 to cancel everything.###.###uh-huh.###.###so what they do --n40208d is that, that they cancel the insurance	###.###right.###so,
155674:184	###.###yeah.###.###and so i have a lot of job experience###and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants --n40271e###and he can give me access and tell me what to do --n4027fb and just turn me --n402812 loose###.###yeah.###.###but in, in the same token, it's a very, really enjoyable for me because i don't have --n402961 to have, you know, nobody breathing down my back	###.###uh-huh.###.
155812:52	###.###uh-huh.###.###we aren't tackling a massive ballot every four years.###.###uh, the other, the other thing that, uh, --n402589 bothers me about our system is just that, uh, in, for, for, in, in, in congress the amount of power any, any particular congress critter has --n402658 is based --n402667 on their seniority and how long they've been there --n402696###so it's, you know, for, you know, uh,###so unless you have actual, you know, across the board s-, uh, limitations, the, uh, you know, the idea of,###well, we're going --n402be8 to just, we're,### i'm, i'm just going --n402cc6 to, you know, vote, vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work,	###.###uh-huh.### i think, i think that that's true,
155860:18	###.###well, i mean, l-,###t-,###i don't see why it makes a big difference the c i a --n403de9 because, you know, officially they don't do, they don't have any operations within the united states other than administrative.###.###yeah,###that's officially.###.###uh-huh.###.	###but i, i think that there are, there are advantages to having seniority and, uh, turn-, or, not having a complete turnover every, some small number of years.###i think there are, i mean there's an institutional memory that you need --n404381 to maintain --n404390.###.
155867:156	###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, we all know that that's not necessarily true.###but i, i think that there are, there are advantages to having seniority and, uh, turn-, or, not having a complete turnover every, some small number of years.###i think there are, i mean there's an institutional memory that you need --n404381 to maintain --n404390.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i think that, uh, all, with all the perks that we've given them --n4044ff,	###.###uh-huh.###.
155881:48	###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks.###.###.###so, how you like new jersey --n40002e.###.###uh, it's pretty good, you know.###you get, uh, closer to the, uh, coast here,	###.###right,### i guess, uh, i don't know what part of new jersey you're in --n400339, but i guess it's, uh, fairly industrial.
155925:9	###but i've always considered automobiles to be, probably the, the prime contributor.###i mean there's a lot of contributors,###but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that.###.###oh, d-, definitely.###it's###.###yeah.###.###uh, you know, there are a large number of them on the road.	###and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair.###.### that's, yeah, that's, that's
156020:26	### it's, it's the type of thing there that, uh, you know,###speakeranan*t42-3.###.###the third world countries are less industrial###.###and they want --n4028bd to become industrial###uh-huh.###.###speakerb45-1*t45-1.###so they're on the different part of the cycle of the u s.	###speakeranan*t45-1.###speakera45-2*t45-2.###right.
156123:17	###i've lived in cities that --n40445c really haven't had that much of a problem, although, uh, i'm really kind of based --n4044b3 in orlando, florida###speakerbnan*t73-4.###.###and there, you can tell that it's getting worse.###i mean, it, it definitely it's not at a level comparable to los angeles or denver###.###but you can,###.###.###yeah,	###.###exactly.###.
156312:42	###it's called --n4046a9 intellect### and, and they basically, uh, type out abstracts which --n404723 are really literally,### i've, i've actually read the actual articles,###they're pretty g-,###.###.###okay.###.###okay,###i thought it was supposed --n40005e to give a recording,	###and uh, i, embarrassed --n40025e to say, it's pretty trivial.###.###uh-huh.
156317:25	###.###okay.###.###okay,###i thought it was supposed --n40005e to give a recording,###but anyway, uh, well, i do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for, for my wife and for me###and uh, i, embarrassed --n40025e to say, it's pretty trivial.###.###uh-huh.###.	###but i doubt i do it more than three times a year.###.###uh-huh,
156327:16	### all we, all i do --n40034d is, uh, keep a list of things like debts that --n400388 are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent --n4003eb that month,###but i doubt i do it more than three times a year.###.###uh-huh,###do you use a computer.###.###and,###.###.###no,	###i'm in computer science,###yet i i do everything on paper.###.
156336:62	###no,###i work with them all day,###i'm in computer science,###yet i i do everything on paper.###.###oh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah,###mine is really simple, because i got all our bills paid --n400a41 off when, uh, he was a marine --n400a6c,
156339:28	###yet i i do everything on paper.###.###oh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i don't even use a calculator for the stuff i'm doing --n4008f5 because it's all pretty round numbers.###.###yeah,	###he went to saudi arabia###and while he was gone i got all of our bills paid --n400bba off,###so really the only bills i have --n400c7c is rent, utilities, insurance you know,
156341:27	###oh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i don't even use a calculator for the stuff i'm doing --n4008f5 because it's all pretty round numbers.###.###yeah,###mine is really simple, because i got all our bills paid --n400a41 off when, uh, he was a marine --n400a6c,###he went to saudi arabia	###so really the only bills i have --n400c7c is rent, utilities, insurance you know,###.###uh-huh.
156427:36	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###sure.###.### so, but i, self-employed, you know,###i have my own little cleaning business type thing,###so, uh, i keep,###.	###or,###.###no,
156433:52	### so, but i, self-employed, you know,###i have my own little cleaning business type thing,###so, uh, i keep,###.###do you find trouble --n402776 keeping the records for taxes and all that###or,###.###no,###it's not hard,###i just keep it in a notebook and write down what i've made --n4028c3 and, uh, you know, what it's going --n4028f6 to have --n402905 to go for --n402918 that month	###.###uh-huh.###.
156453:5	###.###do you.###.###i don't understand the idea of paying somebody --n402d21 to, to do it.###.###huh.###.###it seems like it's absurd the number of people who --n402e46 end up --n402e55 having --n402e60 to pay somebody --n402e73 to do it.###.###r-,	###you fill in the blanks and go.###.###i,
156537:44	###.###and it's eating us --n400497 alive budget wise###and, uh,###.###so are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state.###.###yes,###we do practice capital punishment,###.###.	###.###yes,###that's similar to georgia.
156543:183	###yes,###we do practice capital punishment,###.###.###but the nature of the, uh, courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed --n40069a.###.###yes,###that's similar to georgia.###.###yeah.	###.###that's probably true considering,###.
156543:200	###yes,###we do practice capital punishment,###.###.###but the nature of the, uh, courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed --n40069a.###.###yes,###that's similar to georgia.###.###yeah.	###.###that's probably true considering,###.
156622:29	###.###but it's not going --n402071 to,###.###.###oh, i see.###.###see, i'm talking about,###like, in, in,###uh, i'm afraid i think that there are kids who --n40220d just ought --n40221c to be taken --n40222f out of their homes and reared --n40224e.###uh, i know the institutions don't work that well,	###i have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids.###.###uh-huh.
156638:12	###and i have the same thirty-seven in my office every day.###.###um.###.###and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible.###some of them in the penal system.###.###so that's a difficult situation.###.###and, you know, you just see those kids going down the road.	###but some of them have already been in youth centers. and that kind of thing,###.###um.
156645:41	###so that's a difficult situation.###.###and, you know, you just see those kids going down the road.###now, not all of them will commit offenses that --n40288d have --n402898 to do with capital punishment,###but some of them have already been in youth centers. and that kind of thing,###.###um.###.###and if we had something to do --n402a89 before they get --n402a9c to be full-blown adult criminals,###and i'm not talking about necessarily in the school system,	###.###uh-huh.###.
156728:6	###.###.###uh-huh.###well, you always have castration.###.###well, you know, somebody elected that recently.###.###yes,###i read about that.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
156783:6	###i think a lot of it was, was just that, you know, becau-, because of, of the, audi-, you know, because, because the majority of the high risk groups were people no one really cared about --n401510.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###that,###.###right,	###.###uh-huh.###.
156783:59	###i think a lot of it was, was just that, you know, becau-, because of, of the, audi-, you know, because, because the majority of the high risk groups were people no one really cared about --n401510.###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###that,###.###right,	###.###uh-huh.###.
156813:32	###.###so, uh,###.###yes.###.###uh, do you think, d-, you mean, do you actually think we're doing enough --n401e47 right now to,###.###no,###i really don't.### i did, i did like a research kind of thing on aids research and stuff,	###i mean, most of what --n402188 gets raised --n402197, i mean, it's not really federal movement,###most of what --n4022b4 gets raised --n4022c3, gets raised --n4022d6 by, uh, uh, you know, conscious, yeah, communities and things like that, you know.###.
156822:62	### i did, i did like a research kind of thing on aids research and stuff,###and, uh, really we're not doing much at all,###i mean, most of what --n402188 gets raised --n402197, i mean, it's not really federal movement,###most of what --n4022b4 gets raised --n4022c3, gets raised --n4022d6 by, uh, uh, you know, conscious, yeah, communities and things like that, you know.###.###private organizations.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	### and and, uh, get, they get donations from the community, you know, they're real, and from corporations around the, around the city, you know, for aids research and that kind of thing###.###uh-huh.
156899:56	### i think it's, i think it stands a really interesting question of, uh,###.###.###so, uh, you know, my feeling is that, uh, it's really being used --n40005e today,### it, it, you know, it, it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up --n4001d3 waiting on appeal --n4001e6.###.###right,###i think i've seen some statistics that --n400409 say that, uh, it --n400428's more expensive --n40043b to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life.###.###right	###.###right.###.
156899:72	### i think it's, i think it stands a really interesting question of, uh,###.###.###so, uh, you know, my feeling is that, uh, it's really being used --n40005e today,### it, it, you know, it, it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up --n4001d3 waiting on appeal --n4001e6.###.###right,###i think i've seen some statistics that --n400409 say that, uh, it --n400428's more expensive --n40043b to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life.###.###right	###.###right.###.
156999:53	###yeah.###.###i think it's mainly, people, like, they get the vengeance of it.###.###yeah,###well it's also,###.###because, you know,###.###i used --n40383b to live in georgia	###but if you look at who --n4039dc gets accused --n4039eb and who --n4039fa are the ones who --n403a11 actually get executed --n403a24, it's very racially related and ethnically related,###.###oh, yeah
157091:57	###and, uh, it seems --n400736 to just blow the com-, compe-, competition away.###.###it terms of handling, uh, acceleration,###.###handling, power, everything.###yeah,###it just got like the top rating.###it was compared --n400984 up against, uh,### let's see,###there was like the mazda m x three, uh, nissan's, whatever, their two, n x two thousand, the civic s i	### everybody, all the, uh, raters loved it.### i like the, i like the styling###and, i seen a few of them actually race
157092:16	###.###it terms of handling, uh, acceleration,###.###handling, power, everything.###yeah,###it just got like the top rating.###it was compared --n400984 up against, uh,### let's see,###there was like the mazda m x three, uh, nissan's, whatever, their two, n x two thousand, the civic s i###and it just, you know, it, it dominated over all of them.	### i like the, i like the styling###and, i seen a few of them actually race###and they seem --n400e53 to be really good cars for it.
157219:63	###they want you to buy their car.###yeah,###there,### it was, it was interesting.### i was at, i, i also went to, uh, the porsche###and, uh, it was, it --n4033b7 was amazing how they were completely opposed --n4033da.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah,	###and everything is put --n403630 together with exacting tolerances### and, and then you go to porsche###and it's like, well, uh, these cars are completely handmade --n403753
157277:65	###.###yeah,###that's good.### i also, i was impressed --n40429f by, uh, by the mercedes, too.###.###oh, yeah.###.### i really, i really like the mercedes.###.### but, but if, if you have a problem with a mercedes, you take it into a shop,	###.###the factory was nice###and,
157286:40	### but, but if, if you have a problem with a mercedes, you take it into a shop,### they're going --n4045ab to, they're going --n4045c6 to hit you up for just all kinds of things.###.###the factory was nice###and,###.###.###and is it different for the, for the b m w.###.###uh, i think, well, something on the order of a three series, it's probably different.	###.###probably.###.
157337:63	###there's,###.###so, i think for, for, for many years, uh, we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who --n40119a are, uh, to a great extent, public servants uh,###we have not paid them really what they're worth --n40135f in what they contribute --n401376 to society.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###i agree with that.###.	###.###i guess,### i'm, i'm a student right now
157337:97	###there's,###.###so, i think for, for, for many years, uh, we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who --n40119a are, uh, to a great extent, public servants uh,###we have not paid them really what they're worth --n40135f in what they contribute --n401376 to society.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###i agree with that.###.	###.###i guess,### i'm, i'm a student right now
157342:140	###uh-huh.###.###.###i agree with that.###.###but, uh, then again, uh, it's the, hard --n4014f1 to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends --n401528 on all levels of, of, uh, government, including municipalities as well as state and federal governments.###.###i guess,### i'm, i'm a student right now###and i don't make a whole lot of money	###i go to a state sponsored school###and, uh, my education all up through high school and stuff,###so i guess i'm kind of in debt, i, i suppose, because i don't, you know, been paying taxes all that, all that long.
157344:20	###.###i agree with that.###.###but, uh, then again, uh, it's the, hard --n4014f1 to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends --n401528 on all levels of, of, uh, government, including municipalities as well as state and federal governments.###.###i guess,### i'm, i'm a student right now###and i don't make a whole lot of money###and, so, i, i kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to, i guess, uh, compared to what i get --n40190b, because i, you know, all my, my education is state sponsored.###i go to a state sponsored school	###so i guess i'm kind of in debt, i, i suppose, because i don't, you know, been paying taxes all that, all that long.###my parents, i guess --n401e49, h-, h-, however, have contributed to that, you know, for the education side of it and everything,###but, uh, i usually end up --n40201d getting money back.
157345:106	###i agree with that.###.###but, uh, then again, uh, it's the, hard --n4014f1 to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends --n401528 on all levels of, of, uh, government, including municipalities as well as state and federal governments.###.###i guess,### i'm, i'm a student right now###and i don't make a whole lot of money###and, so, i, i kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to, i guess, uh, compared to what i get --n40190b, because i, you know, all my, my education is state sponsored.###i go to a state sponsored school###and, uh, my education all up through high school and stuff,	###my parents, i guess --n401e49, h-, h-, however, have contributed to that, you know, for the education side of it and everything,###but, uh, i usually end up --n40201d getting money back.###i will this year anyway from a,
157381:85	###and what i mean --n402691 by that, the more income you make --n4026bc, the more tax you pay --n4026db.###.###more taxes you pay --n4027bf.###.###it should be, i think --n40281c, a flat percentage###and, uh, that percentage ought --n4028bb to be an equitable amount.###.###uh-huh.###isn't,###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
157381:123	###and what i mean --n402691 by that, the more income you make --n4026bc, the more tax you pay --n4026db.###.###more taxes you pay --n4027bf.###.###it should be, i think --n40281c, a flat percentage###and, uh, that percentage ought --n4028bb to be an equitable amount.###.###uh-huh.###isn't,###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
157388:16	###uh-huh.###isn't,###.###uh, last year when they passed the tax laws for the, uh, nineteen ninety, ninety-one, whatever, nineteen ninety-one --n4029df uh, i added up all the taxes that we were going --n402a16 to pay --n402a25 on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else,###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and basically, uh, we were going --n402cb3 to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax.###.###wow.
157422:44	### the, the, the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay --n403525, i guess --n40353c.###.###but you probably pay more --n403681 percentage wise in other taxes.###.###uh-huh.###there was that,###.###.###which --n403762 can-,###was it jerry brown,	###.###yeah,###if you impl-, implemented a flat percentage, it would encourage people, uh, --n403a7a to make more money
157675:82	###and my sister had gotten through college,###but i was still in high school,###and my mother paid for a lot of my sister's college while my parents were together###.###yes.###.###and then, uh, before the divorce she had saved for my college.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###oh.###.
157679:24	###yes.###.###and then, uh, before the divorce she had saved for my college.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, when we had the divorce --n402bdf, she just didn't get much money out of it and had --n402c1a to spend it all on --n402c35 getting another house.###.###oh.###.	###.###well, good,###good.
157723:11	###.### and i, and i don't spend over that.###.###well, great,###great.###and sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and, and sheet music and stuff you've got --n403769 to work on --n40377c, too.###.###oh, sure,### there's, there's always music books to buy --n40390a.###.	###.###.###oh, yes,
157869:29	###.###both my husband and i work###and our children are sixth, fourth, and third grade.###and the school years are wonderful,###they're just wonderful.###.###uh-huh.###.###the kids, they are real people###and they are interesting	###.###.###and, um, i think as parents we really enjoy them in, in our personal situation
157955:95	###my husband is a physician,###so, uh, i, i mumblex i talk to parents about this a lot.###but children,### i, i think working mothers or mothers who --n402642 choose --n40264d to work outside the home, um, need very early --n402680 to come to grips with any guilt, that they feel --n4026b3 and decide what --n4026c6's best for them and their family.###.###yeah.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and i long ago decided i'm a better mother because i work outside the home.###.###uh-huh.
158001:11	###.###uh-huh.###.### it's a wonderful, it --n40379c's wonderful to be a mother###but, uh, i like th-, i like the way i did it --n4038aa.###.###right.###.###i sort of worked half time.###i had very flexible hours.	###and i, you can do that despite working very easily which --n403b27 is one of the things i preach --n403b4e all the time to, to mothers.###.###oh.

158150:88	###yes.###.###yeah.### th-, the one of which --n400642 was, uh, something, something that --n400669's been going on because of the rodney king trial here in town### and that is, uh, and that is the exclusion of jurors because of --n400821 or in spite of --n400838 their race. uh,###.###oh, really.###.###yeah.###well, they, they, uh, the, the people that mumblex	###.###uh-huh.###.
158183:33	###.###yeah.###it was everywhere.###.###yes.###.###so you know,###and i, i think it --n4013a4 would be very difficult to find someone, uh, find a panel that --n4013f3 would be, not have seen it and, and known of what --n40143a was going on.###.###oh, i agree with you	###.###exactly.###you know, um, the you know,
158183:144	###.###yeah.###it was everywhere.###.###yes.###.###so you know,###and i, i think it --n4013a4 would be very difficult to find someone, uh, find a panel that --n4013f3 would be, not have seen it and, and known of what --n40143a was going on.###.###oh, i agree with you	###.###exactly.###you know, um, the you know,

158305:34	###.### you would know, the whole world would know what you were facing --n40445f.###and then it's a matter of, of deciding,###.###.###okay.###well, um, i used --n400044 to work in a day care center.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and it is, they can be deceiving to people.###i did not work there long because i couldn't handle the, the treatment that the children got --n4002c9,###and this is supposed --n4003c2 to be a very well-known center here in tyler who --n4003f1 had two or three, um, centers, all over, you know, the, um, city
158308:76	###.###.###okay.###well, um, i used --n400044 to work in a day care center.###.###uh-huh.###.###i worked in, um, in all the different areas of the day care center###and it is, they can be deceiving to people.###i did not work there long because i couldn't handle the, the treatment that the children got --n4002c9,	###.###uh-huh.###.
158431:92	###and she was fabulous.###.###uh-huh.###.###she loved them babies,###and she loved them and cared for them.###but, um, every one of the others that i saw --n402ae6 was just screaming and yelling and, um, you know, would make me a nervous wreck,###so, you know.###.###yeah.	###but if they don't reach out and touch the kids, then that doesn't do any good.###.###yeah,
158431:122	###and she was fabulous.###.###uh-huh.###.###she loved them babies,###and she loved them and cared for them.###but, um, every one of the others that i saw --n402ae6 was just screaming and yelling and, um, you know, would make me a nervous wreck,###so, you know.###.###yeah.	###but if they don't reach out and touch the kids, then that doesn't do any good.###.###yeah,
158435:31	###she loved them babies,###and she loved them and cared for them.###but, um, every one of the others that i saw --n402ae6 was just screaming and yelling and, um, you know, would make me a nervous wreck,###so, you know.###.###yeah.### i, i, i think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and p h d's and all that kind of thing and, you know, know all the technical stuff,###but if they don't reach out and touch the kids, then that doesn't do any good.###.###yeah,	###.###yeah.###.
158600:39	###huh, yeah,###okay.###.###.###sure.###.###uh, i mean i really, i really think that, that, my gut feeling is that, that, you know, he pretty much picked, picked the fight with, uh, with, um, hussein.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###.
158680:15	###right.###um,###.###well, do we.###.###what do you do --n40018c.###.###um,###.###i guess that,	###.###my tax bracket is, is pretty high up there.### i pay the, i generally pay the maximum tax bracket.
158697:97	###and, uh, i think that we're paying too much###because i don't have any children.###.###right.###.###and i pay a lot of property taxes.###.###oh, sure.###.### i don't have any, um, i don't, you know, i don't use an awful lot of city services.	###.###uh-huh.###.
158737:35	###.###huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###i'm sure.###.###um, you look at your paycheck	###.###.###um, what kind of, what kind of,
158766:25	###no,###no,###i haven't.###.### i, uh, i haven't done any of that type of work myself.###.###uh-huh.###.###um, but every once in a while when i hear up here at, at, uh, in d c area, um, one of the radio stations has been talking about the, the congress --n401fc9,###um, congress has added too towards the members bank there, you know,	###and i guess it went defunct recently.###.###uh-huh.
158775:59	###um, congress has added too towards the members bank there, you know,###there's a bank that they all bank with --n40225c,###and i guess it went defunct recently.###.###uh-huh.###.###and one of the congressmen has, has written in the last three years al-, about a thousand bad checks.###.###huh.###.	###no interest,###no repayment schedule.###.
158816:15	###.###forty-two cents out of every dollar i make --n402bf2 goes to the government,###.###.###and then they charge me sales tax###and they charge me gasoline taxes,###.###uh-huh.###mumblex taxes.###.	###and it's just too expensive.###.###uh-huh.
158822:47	###.###uh-huh.###mumblex taxes.###.###and they charge me all these others,###and it's just too expensive.###.###uh-huh.###.###i can't believe that	###.###huh.###.
159107:30	###uh-huh.###.### there's not, there is not a whole lot of, you know, funded research from,###.###.###okay.###so, uh, mike, what are your opinions on, uh, trial by jury --n400070.###.###well i work for an insurance company###so i see a lot of, uh, verdicts that --n40019b are pretty crazily decided --n4001b2. um, by juries particularly,	###you know juries will decide the guilt or innocence,###but then they leave the awards up to more learned people.###and i think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous, you know, like millions and millions of dollars.
159124:59	### that, that seems --n4005d8 to make sense###but leave it up to the more experienced person who --n40068c knows how it fits --n4006a3 into the, uh, kind of the rate for different mumblex.###.###oh, exactly.###each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what, um, the going, you know, if you will the going, uh, award should be --n4008aa for a certain type of case, you know, within some kind of range.###.###uh-huh.###.###when you get one way out like that --n400adb###but then really doesn't pen-, wind up --n400b71 penalizing the person that they went after --n400b94.	###.###right.###.
159134:10	###who it really penalizes --n400c8a is their insurance company which --n400ca5 then translates into higher rates for all of us. if they get some of those mega awards against them.###.###right.###.###you know, they're not going --n400e74 to sit there and lose money.###if they are losing money, then they're going --n400f52 to raise rates.###.###right.### th-, they ha-,###.	###.###right.###.
159134:33	###who it really penalizes --n400c8a is their insurance company which --n400ca5 then translates into higher rates for all of us. if they get some of those mega awards against them.###.###right.###.###you know, they're not going --n400e74 to sit there and lose money.###if they are losing money, then they're going --n400f52 to raise rates.###.###right.### th-, they ha-,###.	###.###right.###.
159147:108	###.###and, uh, granted some people need --n4011a0 to be compensated --n4011b3 if they have really been wronged --n4011d2, you know.###.###well, how do you feel --n4012e8 about setting, like, well, for example, a car type accident where, uh, or some incident where someone loses a limb --n40135b.###.###.###do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm, a dollar figure for losing different body parts.###.###i don't know.###you know some of the health insurance is written --n401659 that way. you know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it s-, pre specified in the policy so much	###.###uh-huh.###.
159178:31	###.###you know, to get into the economics of things, uh,###because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards, it really, you know, ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying --n40242b for get away.###.###yeah.###.###.###that's true.###.###if it's a company, you know that they're insured.	###.###huh.###.
159298:15	###and she's real interested in geriatrics.###.###well, that sounds good.###.###yeah.###so, uh, she, she's real interested in, uh, what ann richards has been doing --n400862.### she's, ann richards is really cracking down on, uh, the nursing homes###and, i don't know, you wouldn't know anything about a texas governor.###.###i've heard the name	###.###okay.###ann richards is our governor in texas
159382:38	###my grandfather passed away several years ago.###i was much younger.###but, uh, he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life###and someone visited him every day.###my grandmother did.###but, uh, if she couldn't, someone visited him every day.###it was in a very small town nursing home.###.###uh-huh.###.	###they didn't care about what --n402abd went on.###.###yeah.
159391:54	###.###and, uh, people didn't get paid --n402a1b much there at all.###they didn't care about what --n402abd went on.###.###yeah.###.###they would let a, let a patient get a lot of bed sores.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and then, the nurses and doctors really didn't put any for, forth any loving care for them.###.###either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford --n402f34 to put in the, uh, care that they need --n402f67. cause it's, you know,
159403:37	###.###either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford --n402f34 to put in the, uh, care that they need --n402f67. cause it's, you know,###.###right.###.###.###right.###.###an elderly person can, you know,###it's like a newborn baby.	###.###uh-huh.###.
159494:30	###.###uh, i like classical music.###i like rock and roll.###.###uh-huh.###.###i like country and western.###.###okay.###.	### i like, i like different things about each one of them.###.###well, i like most of them except for country music.
159539:16	###.###uh, this stuff, makes you cry it sounds so sad --n40110e.###.###.###i mean you d-,###.###that's the kind you like --n40120d you mean --n401220.###.###yeah.### som-, sometimes i do.	###.###oh.###oh, okay.
159616:14	###okay.###.###but, uh,###so no###i haven't.### i, you know, i used --n40286f to go out and dance a lot###but i don't do that anymore either.###so.###.###oh, i see.	###.###no.###.
159663:63	###.###oh, rea-,###were they religious.###.###yes.###.###uh, i see.###i,###.###so, i'm always behind.	###but i know what i like --n40366d when it's, uh, when i like a sound. a certain kind of sound --n4036b8,###yeah.###.
159760:51	###.###okay.### i'm not, i'm not very good at remembering the, uh titles,###.###the titles and artists.###.###yeah,###but i can remember this, the song.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah.###.
159766:25	###yeah,###but i can remember this, the song.###yeah.###.###well, do do you watch music television, m t v --n404e58 at all. or v h one.###.###yeah.###.###.###no,	###.###okay.###.
159827:12	###but it's big enough.###.###uh-huh.###.###and they have a, they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything --n400289###and i wish they did.###.###yeah.###.###you know, they have a four o one k,	###.###uh-huh.###.
159894:29	###uh, on the other hand, you know, i, i had a similar, had a similar health plan###and, uh, one of my kids was in a car accident###and, uh i had, wound up --n402776 having --n402785 to pay for, you know, a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of, you know, no, no insurance policy happened --n402810 to cover it, which --n40282b is,###.###um.###.###.###really.###you mean, not even your, your, your car insurance.###.	###no fault here,### and, and i had a high deductible on the on the, uh, on the c-, car insurance###and then s-, you know, we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and blew it.
159955:4	### it's, it's, uh, no longer.###so that's what,###i think it's still based on the old model of,### and, and now they don't, uh,###.###a lifelong job security###telephone pioneers of america,###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah,###but they, no, no longer.
160175:18	###that's the only way i could really,###.###the one in florida is so cool because they pick up everything.###they pick up newspapers and, uh, you know, milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans, you know, like soup --n400b52 comes in --n400b61 and stuff.###.###uh-huh.###.###they pick up everything.###.###during the summers, like the, around where i live --n400d0f the, uh, homeless people see-,	###.###uh-huh.###.
160215:18	###it piles up.###.###so what's a guy --n4014d2 to do --n4014e1. you know.. i asked myself --n401508.###.###.###i just don't know.###.###.###i just don't know###and now they have, like bins and stuff that --n401681 are a little more convenient because, mean, until seven o'clock, you got --n4016c8 to pay --n4016d7 to park at the student center,	###.###really.###huh, oh, yeah,
160251:19	###.###uh-huh.###.###but i don't really, i don't ever take anything.###.###well, i mean, it's real,###you ought --n401fcc to, because the, the, the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###but wait###.
160255:12	###.###well, i mean, it's real,###you ought --n401fcc to, because the, the, the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything.###.###uh-huh.###.###and since we go there all the time, i mean###.###but wait###.	###.###i've never seen you before.###.
160349:20	###really not.###did you know that, like, something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper. filled --n403569 with paper.###.###um.###.###.###paper just seems so innocuous.###.###huh.###.	###.###well, it is, it is, though.###.
160432:23	###well, i mean, i think we've kind of, you know,###.###what do you think --n404957.###.###i mean, everybody, everybody everybody has a computer.###.### kind of radical, i know --n404a9b###but,###.###.	###.###that's true.###.
160475:16	###i get a newsweek --n40090d every week which i, i pretty much read --n400938 that cover to cover###and i, as far as, you know,###that satisfies most of the short term news i get --n400ae5.###uh, don't watch much t v,### don't have enough time###and, uh, don't listen to the radio --n400c5b too much especially the news channels or anything like that, you know,###they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened###.###yeah.###.	###uh, but most of my news probably comes from newsweek###and for the longer term i, i read, uh, like scientific american and, and, uh, readers' digest and some of those other types of magazines that --n401018 come out which, they,###the news isn't, like, immediate what you'd generally think of --n4011e7 as news,
160529:77	### i, i, i do like, uh, u s news and world report.###i don't get --n40222c to read it as much as i like,###but that's, i think that's a good magazine.###.###yeah,###i think they're about the same.### i, you know, they, they certainly have a very similar, uh, charter at least in my mind.###and, uh, uh, what, what kind of, uh, what kind of news --n4025e3 normally interests you,###i mean what do you, what, what do you find --n402729 interesting versus what do you find --n402748 boring.###.	###.###.###uh-huh.
160591:30	###.###yeah.###.###and there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist,###even amongst themselves, they're being somewhat protectionist, you know.###.###yeah.###.###like, england doesn't want --n403dbc to do one thing### and, and sweden doesn't want --n403e52 to do other thing	###.###uh-huh.###.
160641:19	###course, you can always mislocate it. or misplace it, i mean, not mislocate it, but misplace it###.###.###and,###.###.###i don't think anybody pays too little.###.###no,###i would tend --n4000ba to agree very highly.	###.###do you get hit --n400262 up for local taxes there.###.
160787:18	### the-, there is just way too much bureaucracy###and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running, keep the paper shuffling around instead of real, you know, good programs.###.###you know, like we,###.###.###yeah,###i mean, we, we spend a fortune for things like v a hospitals###and, you know, then you look at how well they're managed --n40339a --n4033a1, you know,###i don't think we're getting our money's work out, worth out of there.	###.###right,###and a lot of it's feeding that.
160821:34	###they think,###.###.###oh, yeah,###and then they go and say, i'm not c-,###congress, they're the fault for it.###.###right.###.###but, you know, the other thing is, it's tricky, though,	###.###right.###.
160904:21	###what kind.###.###i have a schnauzer###and i have a sheltie.###.###schnauzers.###is it a miniature --n400238 or a standard --n40024b schnauzer.###.### it, it's a miniature.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
161215:26	###i think it's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff, is qualification of people who --n400dd9 work there,###and in hiring people who --n400f03 would work at the, uh, day care, the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people, uh, in terms of, not just, just###because somebody has a child or, uh, likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified --n401171 to give the child the kind of supervision and training that that, uh,###.###oh, absolutely.###.###.###as a matter of fact, i believe that the safety and, and health, uh, issues, uh, depend in a very direct way on the people who --n4013bc are working with the children.###.###exactly.	###.###and it --n401669's the most difficult of all for a parent, judge, uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving,###.
161217:28	###because somebody has a child or, uh, likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified --n401171 to give the child the kind of supervision and training that that, uh,###.###oh, absolutely.###.###.###as a matter of fact, i believe that the safety and, and health, uh, issues, uh, depend in a very direct way on the people who --n4013bc are working with the children.###.###exactly.###and that was the most difficult thing of all, to find the, the right people, the qualified people.###.	###.###oh,###.
161225:61	###and that was the most difficult thing of all, to find the, the right people, the qualified people.###.###and it --n401669's the most difficult of all for a parent, judge, uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving,###.###oh,###.###but if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children, and be aware of what the safety hazards are --n40183a,###.###oh, exactly.###and the other thing that --n40195a's difficult in, uh, it's --n401981 a too small setting, like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child, because you don't want --n4019f8 to just warehouse the child,	###and you have --n401dc6 to have the right kind of enrichment###and that, that includes, uh, an atmosphere in which the child is safe and, and he's watched --n401eb6 and his physical needs are cared for --n401ed9 --n401ee0,###but also his, uh, developmental needs are cared for --n402064, too.
161235:18	###and i didn't want --n401bc9 to run an institution where that was the case --n401bf4, where all we were doing --n401c17 were warehousing --n401c26 because the first four, five years or so important###and you have --n401dc6 to have the right kind of enrichment###and that, that includes, uh, an atmosphere in which the child is safe and, and he's watched --n401eb6 and his physical needs are cared for --n401ed9 --n401ee0,###but also his, uh, developmental needs are cared for --n402064, too.###.###maybe the right thing to do --n402100 is to, uh,###when a couple has a child --n4021c7, then they should both take, you say the first four or five years are the most important, and i think i would agree with that, they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting.###.###that would be lovely.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
161240:82	###maybe the right thing to do --n402100 is to, uh,###when a couple has a child --n4021c7, then they should both take, you say the first four or five years are the most important, and i think i would agree with that, they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting.###.###that would be lovely.###.### get rid --n40249f of all these child care centers, at least for young kids below the age of six.###.###uh-huh.###.### and then, uh, and then, of course, to make up for that, uh, the, uh, parents would have --n40261c to work in their later years longer, you know,	###uh,###.###well, that's an interesting thought because,
161277:25	###if they didn't have --n4034a7 to do a lot of physical, uh, labor, they could main-, maintain, uh,###.###.###so, what kind of music you into --n400032.###.###well, i have a, uh, pretty wide taste, uh, in music, ranging from progressive rock to jazz to, uh, lot of different forms of, uh, music.###in fact, it --n400258's easier for me to say, uh, the types of music that i don't like --n4002ab are opera and, uh, screaming heavy metal.###.###the opera, yeah, it's right on track.###i like classical,	###.###.###and heavy metal, uh, it's noisy.
161337:66	###that's good.###.###i think it is.###.###i'm impressed.###.###uh, for a while there, music seemed to really ha-, popular music seemed --n4017e6 to have, uh, not a lot of point to it.###i was really tired of, uh, the michael bolton.###.###.	###.###.###oh, yeah.
161345:43	###.###.### mi-, michael bolton really got on my nerves because he, he was making all this money --n401a1f doing mediocre cover tunes.###.###.###oh, yeah.###.###and i could, uh, go down to a bar that --n401b9a's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money.###.###uh, but he picked the right songs	###.###i guess.###.
161357:11	###i guess.###.###.###that, and a marvelous hairdo.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###yeah,###i'm sure that, that so-, that sold a lot for him.	### i'm ki-, i've kind of like developed a, a short hatred for, for pop.###.###.
161460:13	###yeah###.###yeah.###.###i had a little sail,###.###well, we don't get --n40062c to do a whole lot of that up here.###.###no.###.	###.###what part of texas you from --n400791.###.
161472:3	###what part of texas you from --n400791.###.###uh, nacogdoches.###.###okay,###whereabouts is that --n40084a.###.###that's between houston and dallas.###.###okay,	###.###it's the oldest town in texas.###.
161539:30	###we went and, uh, had a, kind of a picnic in the woods type thing.###it was pretty nice,###but, uh, no, i, i have, uh, i had a boat --n401473 --n40147a last summer that i took --n401495 out, a catamaran that i do, did a lot of sailing --n4014d0 on --n4014db and stuff.###.###yeah.###.###that's a lot of fun,###but, uh, my parents are pretty big sailors, too,###they're kind of into it.###.	###.###oh, yeah,###i guess it's pretty, uh, fishing's a pretty big thing,
161577:3	###.### let me see,###houston's north.###.###yeah.###okay.###.###dallas is south.###.###oh, okay,	###well, that sounds pretty good.###does, uh,###i guess the weather,
161600:12	###okay,###well, that's pretty temperate.###yeah,###that's not too bad.###but, uh, yeah,###have you done, uh, any other boating then###or,###.###no,###i hadn't done any in a l-, uh, lately,	###i used --n4025af to ha-, uh, have a friend that owned, --n4025f2 his daddy owned a boat shop.###.###yeah.
161658:19	###yeah.###.###so it's, it's not too bad,###it's pretty easy to get the hang of --n403751, i think --n403768###and, uh, generally, everybody i've, i've known --n403852 has kind of gotten into it,###but some people are more motorboaters, you know which --n40397e is fine.###.###yeah.###.###.	###.###yeah,###yeah,
161693:35	###yeah,### i haven't, i haven't personally done that,###but, uh, the races,### i, i work with a guy --n40426a right now that, uh, --n404289 races catamarans in the summertime###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, he's pretty gassed about it.###he's got a good, uh,###.	###.###well, he, uh, he's from detroit###.
161740:17	###.###well###.###well that,###.###they have a, you know, worldwide,###but###.###right.###.	###.###oh, okay.###.
161753:12	###.###.###great.###yeah,###how do you like it down there in texas --n40504a.###.###it's real nice.###.###yeah.###.	###.###oh, no doubt.###.
161821:7	###i mean, it seems like our, our, the prison systems, we can't seem --n400e60 to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system.###.###yeah,###i think most people regard it as a warehouse. where you put away the people that --n401048 are so bad that, uh, you don't want them out in circulation --n40108b.###.###yeah.###.###.### but, but the problem is, is that we, we only have but so much room###and we, we try --n40135b to put aside in the warehouse,	###.###yeah.###.
161857:42	###.###oh.###.### in a in a maximum security prison down in central virginia.###.###i see.###.###.###uh.###.	### the, the people that she had the most problems with --n401dba were the people that --n401dd1 ran the prison.###.###.
161969:44	###speakeranan*t73-1.###speakera73-2*t73-2.### i don't, i don't remember the, the gentleman's name,###but the, the, uh, the mayor of baltimore is a, is a rhodes scholar###speakerbnan*t73-2.###.###and what he,###.###is he the guy --n40496c wants --n404977 to, like, deregulate heroin, or something.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
162187:6	###because i guess, uh,###i mean, well, ninety-twos, granted --n40455b,###but the new ones, you know###.###uh-huh.###.###fourteen to sixteen is what they go for --n404665 on the lot,###.###right.###.	###and, s-, the dealer comes out --n4047a3 okay you know,###.###yeah
162224:123	###.###uh, so, uh, what are your benefits like --n40003e at your job,###and how do you feel --n4000e1 about them.###.###uh, pretty good, actually.###i work for hewlett packard###and they have, uh, a pretty good, uh, benefits package.###in fact, they're, they're kind of known --n4002a0, uh, for --n4002b7 having good benefits.###the pay isn't fabulous,###although i saw a survey recently	###.###oh, that's good.###.
162291:11	###uh-huh.###.###uh, they don't cover eyes though,###and i, i have contact lenses,###so that's kind of a pain.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, you know, i i can live,###.	###.###.###oh, yeah,
162421:28	###he's, uh, specifically an engineer and, and does work with, uh, the hewlett packard machines that --n4042e0 do, uh, uh, sonographic imagining###.###right,###right.###.###and, uh, i've been over --n40445d to see his complex over there###and it's amazing.###.###uh-huh.###.	### and, and, uh, he seems really, really happy with the, the set up.###.###yeah,
162452:93	###.###well, needless to say, here in washington, d c this is the war zone.###uh, d c around here stands for drug capital or death capital.###.###.### it's, uh, it's really bad here.###uh, for example, the, uh, local high school, uh, they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns###.###jeez.###.	###so,###.###well, luckily, it hasn't gotten that bad here.
162551:26	###right.###and it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school --n40267d###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, of course, the mayor, uh, of d c is having a real problem, uh, trying --n402786 to,###what do you do --n40287b to, to reduce crime in a, in a major city like d c where it's a way of life for everybody --n4028f2.### it's, uh, i would hate --n402a7f to have --n402a8e to wrestle with that problem.###i don't know what, what the solution is --n402b9e.###uh, there's no way they can stop the drugs --n402c66,	###.###well, uh, there's a couple of things that i've heard --n402dbf,###.
162584:21	###.###and they're accidental parents half the time anyway.###.###yeah,###and their friends are driving mercedes###and, so it's actually,###they grow up with that as their way of life###and, uh, i think, uh, to a large extent, they don't understand the concept that what they're doing --n403808 is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised --n40383f --n403846.###.###it's illegal,	###.###right###exactly,
162647:18	###well, i was, i was, uh, originally chosen --n4002f9 primarily, i think --n400314, because i was a young fellow###and they tend --n400442 to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict.###i don't know why.###something i picked --n400589 up in a psychology class some time ago.###.###oh, really.###.###yeah,###it's that the younger they are --n4006a4, they tend --n4006b7 to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason,###and they kind of liked me.	###and they,###i don't know what they saw --n4008c2 in me,###but they saw it.
162703:68	###.###yeah,###many laws, but little justice.###.###say,###but, uh,###and i also think, just like you were talking about --n4028be before, why you were chosen --n4028dd to be on a jury --n4028f8 that, uh, the, just, the process of picking jurors is not always objective.###.###oh, certainly not,###certainly not.	###but they're really looking for someone who --n402ccc will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires.###you know, the,###because you get up
162902:77	###do you work now.###.###i don't know###.###.###that's something i've considered --n403192.###uh,###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
162910:15	###uh-huh.###.###i always kind of think it --n403253 would be neat to be able --n403276 to watch them and be there for them all the time.###.###uh-huh.###.###is that what you do --n4033e3.###.###uh, yeah.###actually, i teach my kids at home,	###.###oh, so they don't go to school.###is it like, uh,
162940:27	###not,###it depends on the state you live --n40388e actually.###some laws absolutely prohibit it.###some states, uh, say that you have --n403984 to be a certified teacher in order --n4039a7 to do that.###our state doesn't yet, say that###and i'm not a certified teacher.###i went to college,### but i, you know, but my kids are only elementary grades, levels right now###and so,###.	###.###one of them was for a couple of years###and so, you know, my oldest, he was,
162970:9	###and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence###and your defense attorney presents their evidence###and those three guys take the evidence, go off, figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not.###.### ou-, ou-, our judicial system is in such total chaos.###.###.###i think what they need --n40057c to do --n40058b is, they need --n4005a2 to somehow take the money out of it.###i mean, when you have a man that --n4006e7's signed a, a, a statement saying he's guilty --n40072e,###we have a, a family called all day family.	###.###uh-huh.###.
162986:49	###they been trying these people now for twenty-two years, ever since i was a child.###.###wow.###.###and what they've done --n400b4f is they've bought mercedes after mercedes after mercedes is what they've done --n400b8e,### has nothing to do --n400ca5 with justice whatsoever.###.###well, you know, it's, it's one of those things,###i mean, uh, uh, i would have --n400e56 to look at it.### i-, if they did it with the, uh, just the judges, the police have --n400f5b to do a lot better job of --n400f7e making sure that their evidence is airtight	###they know what --n401219's good and what --n401230 isn't,###they'd be able --n4012e4 to say, i'm sorry,###you can't use this as, uh, evidence, you know, because it was either illegally obtained --n4013cf or whatever
163088:85	###yeah.###.###.###um, y-, well, you, you know, you're talking to part of them that --n403b93's paying for that.###.###yeah,###and you're talking to the other half that --n403d21's paying for it###.###that's right.###you know that's, it, it's, it's amazing	###.###yeah,###well, that's another problem.
163173:15	### i just, i noticed it###iowa and other cities like that, it's a nickel per aluminum can.###.###oh.###.###so you don't see too many --n40188d thrown out around the streets. or even bottles.###.###really.###.###.	###.###right.###.
163270:8	###right.###well, who --n40374a wants --n403755 to clean their junk before they throw it away.###.###that's right,###that's right.###it's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher.###.###right,###uh, yeah.###.	###.###.###well, it --n403a04 was nice talking to you.
163334:29	###.###actually, uh, they just recently started a policy of testing drugs, which --n400125 was kind of interesting,###because w-, when i went --n40021e to work for them --n400235, uh, they didn't do that,###but, uh, since then they've, they've started a drug testing policy, not because of their own, uh, convictions, but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that.###.###huh.###.###how about you.###.###uh, no,	###uh, our policies and procedures manual, uh, the furthest it goes --n4006a6 about drugs is in the, kind of the miscellaneous section, or its reasons for immediate dismissal,###.###uh-huh.
163381:27	###we do oil well services.###so, a lot of our clients are oil companies, big oil companies,###and they go out to,###we have engineers who, uh, --n401477 go out to the oil well, to the, to the client's oil well, and, and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff,###so the clients are very concerned that, you know, the engineers who --n40170c go out there are adhering to their drug policy, because they're on their, their, you know, territory and everything,###but the thing that --n4018fe's interesting is that i w-, i'm an engineer and, a software engineer###.###um.###.###and i work in the software, uh, house,	### they've never, you know, they never go out to the, the oil rigs or anything,###and yet, we're getting, we're subjected --n401cf3 to this policy, you know, the same one that, uh, th-, all the engineers have --n401d5a to, to,###well, a little different, actually,
163383:98	###and they go out to,###we have engineers who, uh, --n401477 go out to the oil well, to the, to the client's oil well, and, and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff,###so the clients are very concerned that, you know, the engineers who --n40170c go out there are adhering to their drug policy, because they're on their, their, you know, territory and everything,###but the thing that --n4018fe's interesting is that i w-, i'm an engineer and, a software engineer###.###um.###.###and i work in the software, uh, house,###and everybody there, you know, are all software engineers.### they've never, you know, they never go out to the, the oil rigs or anything,	###well, a little different, actually,###but, uh, you know, we have --n401f82 to go through the same thing,### and it's, but it's, uh, it's a little different, i guess --n402096 than, than a lot of drug policies.
163461:20	### and, and when i got in there --n40478b, i didn't, i wasn't, like, able --n4047c2 to give a full sample,###and so they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes, drink a whole ton of water before i went to any of the interviews and go in there again,###.###oh.###.###.###right.###.### and the, and the, the procedure is utterly humiliating.###you go in there with the doctor,	###and then he examines you.###.###.
163522:172	###well, that might be the difference.###i don't know.###uh, the other thing that, uh, i remember --n40222d seeing --n402238 on t v lately is, uh, had --n402263 to do with,###it's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in america are in the home districts of very powerful people politically###.###right.###.### that, that histor-, for some reason, historical sites with, you know, the, the full federal money and everything seem --n402542 to appear as, as almost as like political favors to, to very strong politicians.###.###yeah,	###.###uh-huh.###.
163607:15	###even just, say, for a small business.###speakeranan*t34-2.###.###uh, i know some,###.###.###type of music is hot down in texas.###.###uh, well, i don't know exactly what --n4000bf's hot down in texas.###i know what --n400183's hot down here with me,	###i don't ever listen to the radio###and that's usually what --n4003ca's hot around here### so, so, what kind of music do you like --n400479.
163635:30	###okay.###.###i'm more, uh, old rock and roll, uh, some new, newer, i guess you would call it --n4008ce heavy metal rock and roll type you know, uh, van halen, that kind of thing.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###what about, uh, classic rock type stations.###.	###we live in a fairly small town,###so uh, classic rock for me is what i have --n400c45, which --n400c54 is like, uh, doors, eagles, jimmy hendrix.###.
163672:24	###you know, ho-, hotel california and that era.###.###yeah,###yeah### that does, that's something you don't, --n4014eb doesn't even sound good --n401506 loud really. you know.###.###yeah.###.###you know, definitely.###uh, so, anything new you like --n4016dc --n4016e3 --n4016ea coming out now, other than folk music, some i might know of --n40172d.	###.###well, down in texas, uh, you know, little, listen to a little country every now and then.###.
163686:38	###yeah,###oh yeah,###here,###.###i'm sure there's a lot of that down there.###.###oh, plenty.### way, way more than i can stand down here.###.###.	###i,###.###well, there, there's a conway twitty twang,
163716:13	### it's, it --n4022cc's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is.###concert tours for country and western sings is, it's, it's quite, quite odd,###but, uh, i don't know,### it's, music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays, i think --n4025f3.###it's becoming not necessarily good music, just popular music, you know.###.###hey,### i, i, i think most artists are in --n4027c4 to make a few bucks.###.###yeah,	###.###but they're not in it --n40295e to say anything or give a message which --n402985 is what they were do-,###.
163771:108	###.###uh-huh.###.###but,###.###yeah,### i-, i-, it's the artist, not the merit.###.###yeah,###exactly.	###but that's, that's what the, point we've reached --n403f90,###so i don't know how how much farther we can digress --n4040a3 before we have --n4040b6 to turn it around and go the other way, at least.###.
163800:26	###that's about how i am --n4045ef on popular music.### i don't, you know, you don't, i don't know enough about it because i just listen,###uh, everything i listen to --n404814 is what i buy --n40482b, not whatever they play --n404846 on the radio###so,###.###well, you have --n404971 to figure out what to buy --n404994,###or do you just buy along the same artist.###.###uh, i,###yeah,	###i don't really switch around to new things very often.###.###yeah.
163882:132	###but mostly petty things and, n-, no, nothing, nothing really too big.###.###right,###well, i guess here we run into that sometime,###but i guess a lot of crimes are done --n40129a with apartment type break ins that type, not much home break ins.###.###right.###.###there are some, but not, not very high.###uh, as far as tellers and things like that, it's not extremely high either.	###.###uh-huh.###.
163914:134	###there's a crime.###.###yeah,###but, uh, i guess most of the things that --n401d09 happen around here are, are pretty, uh, innocuous.###although, uh, from what i hear --n401e50 in the news,### and, and i, i s-, saw an episode of the t v show, cops --n401f40 uh, one time that --n401f5b was in pittsburgh,###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, it, it, it did surprise me, because, you know, they were doing drug arrests and thing, and things like that,	###.###oh, okay.###i don't know,
164113:17	###.###and, uh, they have a, a child that --n4033f1's five years old###and it's really handy for hauling him --n4034d7 around and, and their stuff,###and, of course, as he gets friends, i'm sure --n4035e0 that will be even handier.###so, i know if we were, if we had kids still at home, we're in our fifties now, but, if we had kids still at home, we'd certainly have --n403754 to seriously consider a van just for their functional value.###.###yeah,###i think that we're going --n4039b1 to be, uh, owning a mini van for some years --n4039ec to come.###probably till the kids are out of, uh, high school anyway.###.	###is that something that you'd be interested in --n403c14###or is that,###.
164151:52	###that's the most prevalent crime. uh, the ones that --n400489 really, you know, the ones that --n4004b4 really add up after a while, i guess, you know, from, s-, far as insurance money and stuff like that, insurance costs.###you know, everybody has --n400748 to pay for it indirectly eventually.###.###yeah,### i, i, i wonder if, uh, if drug use is a more prevalent crime, though, because, i mean, so many people use it,###and even though just using is not really,###i mean it is a crime,###.###oh, well, yeah,### that, that, that is a crime.	###uh, speeding is a crime.###.###well, that's true.
164294:30	###yeah,###i know that a, a lot of the lot of murders that you hear about --n403cc6 are people that --n403cd9 know each other.###.###.###i mean,###yeah.###.###and they're the, kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that.###.###.	###but, i, y-, y-, you might be able --n40405e to, uh, stop people, you know,###they're thinking about it,###they know they're going --n404213 to get the chair if they get caught --n40423a.
164388:15	###.###.###needs to be punished --n400f5a or, uh, eliminated --n400f75 from society.###.###i mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again.###.###.###right.###.###.	###.###.###uh-huh.
164419:38	###uh-huh.###.###.###right,###uh-huh.###.###and i don't think, that would really warrant capital punishment.###.###.###uh-huh,	###because they're not really a danger to society.###it was almost really self defense, isn't it, in a case like that.###.
164677:130	###and it's just sort of a, you know, four or five pages that --n403abe covers what --n403acd's going on in plano.###but it's still not an awful lot of news.###.###yeah,###i know.### i, uh, it was, it was a big discovery when, when the times, when the times found out there was a place called orange county --n403d71.###.###.###i mean, the way they, i mean, the way they've been handling it before --n403f82, they practically, they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots --n403fbd to go south of the l a county border.###.	###and, of course, they tend --n4044a6 to cover the county,###and we're not in dallas county,###so they tend --n404592 to ignore places outside of the county.
164733:13	###how do you think that, uh, the viewpoints differ --n40105a.###.###i think a lot of it is just, uh, the fact that in the u s you're so far removed --n401134, uh, in a lot of cases from, say, conflicts### or, or it's not happening in your backyard###.###uh-huh.###.###so it's, it's more of a, it's not as a personal, uh,###the news isn't as personal --n4014e1 in what we receive --n4014fc domestically than, than what --n401517's on shortwave.### it's, b b c is, uh, oh, i don't know the right word, is, is almost, uh,	###.###uh-huh.###.
164850:39	###and it wasn't, we weren't too far removed --n40128d geographically from each other,###but the difference in schools i think --n40136a was pretty substantial###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, one of the things that --n401433 probably would have been better if, is if the entire county had had, had just one school system.###.###right.###.###and that would result in some, uh, could result in more equitable distribution of money	###and the city had a very low tax base###so they didn't have a lot of money to work with --n4018fb.###.
164863:143	###.###uh-huh.###.###as a result, the schools were rundown,###there wasn't as many, you know, of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked --n401a79.###there wasn't as many advanced placement courses --n401b79, uh, when i was a senior --n401ba0 that some other schools had --n401bbb.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, it, it,	###and the, the problem with that is then, then, then people will either, the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away --n40225b to get better schools.###.###yeah.
164889:162	###all these kids have these really supportive, really supportive parents, always up there for something.###.###yeah.###.###you can go to north tyler to the schools###and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is --n402ac6. you know,###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, that has a, a whole lot --n402bd9 to do with it, you know,	###.###uh-huh.###.
164972:19	###.###.###okay,###so what kind of luck --n400040 you been having --n400053 with buying and returning products.###.###uh, not too bad really.###uh, i had a razor that i got --n400188 from christmas that i just, i really didn't want --n4001bb it,###but i got it anyway###and, uh, it was a braun###and they were real good about --n400396 taking it back.	###so, uh, i was able --n400488 to get that back pretty easily.###.###uh-huh.
165050:54	###.###yeah,###i think they're beginning --n401ab8 to.### the, the days of don't buy a car made on a monday or a friday are pretty much going away###and,###.###that's what i thought --n401ca9, too, until i saw the consumer reports issue.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and, uh, essentially, i h-, i don't see much of a trend.###i mean, just like every other time that you look at it --n402014, the honda accords and the civics are right up there.###there's nothing wrong with them.
165084:41	###.###yeah,###that's just it.###technology that --n402791 comes in right now is, is probably not going --n4027cc to be imple-, implemented --n4027e7 until, you know, quite a few years down the road.###but, uh,###.###the computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer --n4029e7.###.###oh, yeah.###yeah,	###.###and can you think of any other industry where###in software they,
165110:35	###.###.###it,###uh, th-, they keep up c-, with it pretty quickly###and that's, that's a real good thing, i guess --n4030e0.###.###yeah.###.###uh, i don't know.###.	###and the macintosh is about the only one that --n403346's going right --n403359 forcing i b m and the rest of the d o s world to follow along.###.###yeah.
165118:21	###uh, i don't know.###.###and the hardware, well, i mean, all the chips that --n403233 make up the hardware are a commodity###and the macintosh is about the only one that --n403346's going right --n403359 forcing i b m and the rest of the d o s world to follow along.###.###yeah.###.###.###right,###they're kind of the leaders right now, you know.	###and you're like, oh, gee, they're reselling a macintosh under a different name.###.###.
165131:34	###.###really,###why don't they just say, almost a mac for half the price --n40375d.###.###yeah, you know.###.###they'd sell more if they were honest.###.###exactly,###almost is the key word, there, too, you know, because i, i really, i've used both	###.###yeah, it it's only an advantage for people who --n403b04 had --n403b0f to use pure d o s. mumblex base.###.
165183:34	###yeah.###all right.###.###but, uh, technically, i'm not actually in the industry.###i don't work a computer company.###.###no.###.###i'm an abuser.###.	###.###but it --n404953's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock --n40498a to you know, keep up with the changes as they happen.###.
165218:61	###and it has eight spark plugs###and it --n40036c's hard to, to get get at them###and plus the time on them.###i just don't have time any more.###uh, as far as maintenance tasks that i do --n400562 myself, i, i usually change the oil and wash the air filter###and i, i had an occasion to change, to have --n4006db to change the battery --n4006f2 once,###but, the brakes, i was really surprised that the brakes.###i wanted,###i do have the background.###i know what --n40094a needs --n400955 to be done --n400968	###and the lube, lubrication system needs --n400b2e to be lubricated --n400b41###and so i, i stay on top of that###but i i wanted my front wheels,
165355:8	###.###uh-huh.###.###and uh, i,###.###.###okay.###thanks.###.###huh.	###.###well, uh, yeah,### we, we do.
165419:28	###uh-huh.###.###and one of these days i am going --n40116c to do something about that i believe --n401193.###.###yeah.###yeah.###.###you know how that goes --n4012a3,###but, uh, uh, if,### she, she handles it pretty well.	###.###so your wife,###.
165440:23	###uh, sort of on a peripheral.###she's, uh, uh, an annuity administrator###.###oh.###.###and so she, uh, she works for an insurance company.###.###uh-huh.###.### but, but she enjoys it.	###and, uh,###.###yeah,
165520:16	###.###and then i use that for food, household expenses,###and then i add my own check to that###and then with that i try and handle, you know, some of the clothes that the girls need --n402e4a and things like that,###.###yeah.###.###but the expenses that we need and have --n402f9b around the house.###.###yeah.	###.###so.###.
144672:32	###but, uh,###.###did you have any fear --n4051b4 working in the hospital with that,###.###that's one thing i've never really feared --n40526e.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, uh, i,###a lot of the, my family, you know, they fear me working like that and, under some, some of those conditions,	###.###uh-huh.###.
164630:51	###so there really is only one major l a now.###.###yeah,###pretty much.###uh, there used --n4020d9 to be, fact, i think there still is --n40210c, the, uh, the daily news which --n402137 runs out of the san fernando valley###.###.###and, uh, they're not bad as far as a, uh, you know, as far as a local paper goes.###in fact, it was kind of weird, because i met the, uh, i met the, i met the editor, uh, while i was on, uh, while i was doing jury service in santa monica one time.###it was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff.	###and, uh it's, it's a pretty good paper,###but, uh, you know, it's not, it's not the times.###.
165329:63	###okay.###.###so, when i changed those over --n40363d, i put on these, these pressed aluminum things###.###um.###.###and, uh, probably about four months ago the water pump decided --n403771 to go out.###.###uh, oh.###.	###.###um.###.
165534:40	### just kind of play it by ear, but keep the, the deductions you know mumblex.###.###yeah.###.###.###yeah,###we###.###.###well jim has, jim has a budget.	###.###uh-huh.###.
165550:80	###.###uh-huh.###.###so, i try --n403603 not to, you know,### we don't, you know, i don't ask for more.###i mean i just try and make it on that.###.###uh-huh.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah.###.
165590:18	###she hasn't effected your budget yet really.###.### not, not really.###not too bad. uh.###.###no.###not like she will later on.###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah###when,
165590:117	###she hasn't effected your budget yet really.###.### not, not really.###not too bad. uh.###.###no.###not like she will later on.###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah###when,
165683:32	###and so, uh.###.###well, like what.###.###well, let's see.### i li-, i like cars that --n400c2f are designed --n400c3e with, with human beings in mind,###.###.###and that's not just the driver and the passenger###but that's the person who --n400df2's working on it,	###.###uh-huh.###.
165941:36	###and what they'll do --n4038ab is they'll recycle it.###because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that, uh, trash, uh, the telephone books are the type of thing that --n4039bc don't break down over a long period of time.###a guy went to a d-, a landfill, dug down five feet and, and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty###because they don't, they don't degrade over such a period of time.###.###well, part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made --n403e02 with a clay based paper.###.###yeah.###.###they contain the glue and stuff	###.###yeah.###.
166014:77	###i'm twenty-three.###.###yeah.###.###so there's maybe a five year gap between us.###.###yeah.###.###so, uh.###.	###it's just a matter where priorities are, at placed --n4015cf --n4015d6. and that, uh, usually as far as families are concerned, there used --n40161d to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home.###.###huh.
166028:49	###.###.###yes.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and now, uh, it --n401875's pretty much an economic necessity of, for most, in most places for both parents to work.###.###do you think it's an economic c-, necessity	###.###i think that's part of it too.###but i do think,
166090:18	###.###so.###i mean i have met people that, uh, both that, that --n402e35 just want --n402e44 to maintain a, the standard of living and those that, that --n402e8b really need the job.###.###okay.###and then, sometimes i, i often, uh, find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. yo-, a microwave, a v c r, a answering machine a, you know, a special, a dishwasher, uh, a refrigerator and some of those items, um, for the, for the, uh,###.###uh-huh.###.###well i guess we're sticking more to social changes	###.###uh-huh.###.
166094:9	###okay.###and then, sometimes i, i often, uh, find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. yo-, a microwave, a v c r, a answering machine a, you know, a special, a dishwasher, uh, a refrigerator and some of those items, um, for the, for the, uh,###.###uh-huh.###.###well i guess we're sticking more to social changes###but, uh people want all of that###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###right.###.
166153:10	###.###right.###.###.###but, uh, i don't, i don't understand the, uh, i don't understand, i guess --n401719, why the schools don-, seem --n40173c to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities --n40176f.###.###uh, well, i don't pretend --n401959 to understand that either.###uh, but i'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that --n401a2c ought --n401a37 to be blamed --n401a4a on the schools.###but then, again, i'm not quite sure where the blame ought --n401b92 to be put --n401ba5 --n401bac. uh, because the, the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-,###it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and, and crime --n401d75.	###and it seems like if you could eliminate one of, of the parts of that circle, whether, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions --n401f5c, that things ought --n401f73 to get better.###so, uh, a-, the other two a-, a-,###they --n40224b're all three social issues and could be addressed --n402276 by the government in any ways. and clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to, to fix --n4022e1
166156:15	###.###but, uh, i don't, i don't understand the, uh, i don't understand, i guess --n401719, why the schools don-, seem --n40173c to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities --n40176f.###.###uh, well, i don't pretend --n401959 to understand that either.###uh, but i'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that --n401a2c ought --n401a37 to be blamed --n401a4a on the schools.###but then, again, i'm not quite sure where the blame ought --n401b92 to be put --n401ba5 --n401bac. uh, because the, the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-,###it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and, and crime --n401d75.###and they all seem --n401e44 to go together.###and it seems like if you could eliminate one of, of the parts of that circle, whether, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions --n401f5c, that things ought --n401f73 to get better.###so, uh, a-, the other two a-, a-,	###but it's just like, i, i don't expect them to know which, which, which part --n4024a7 is best to fix --n4024c6 just like i don't know.### it's, it's a complicated issue.### i, i still don't think i would blame it directly on the school.
166176:6	###.###yeah.###i don't blame it on the teachers in the school. i, although i think that,###i do know for a fact that some of the teachers that i know --n402cf9 personally get paid --n402d0c an awful lot more than,###well, they do quite well for themselves.###.###huh.###well, that's odd because i don't think the teachers in my school district, uh, were well paid.###.###no.	###but there are some school districts out there that --n403059 are very well paid.###i mean i know one family that --n403111's got,###they're both teachers,
166185:12	###no.###not all school districts are well paid.###but there are some school districts out there that --n403059 are very well paid.###i mean i know one family that --n403111's got,###they're both teachers,###and they both have, like second jobs that they work --n403216 in the afternoons.###.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and from their teaching job alone, they pull in forty grand each.###.###yeah.
166243:28	###i'm not,###i haven't been,###i grew up in dallas###but i'm still not a cowboys' man.###i like philadelphia eagles.###.###oh, yeah.###.###yeah.###.	###.###that's my favorite team,###so.
166370:37	###.###sure.###.### and but,###.###well, i think they're starting --n402467 to realize that.###a lot of the, like the big eight teams that --n40252b used --n402536 to run so much. i think they're starting --n402569 to realize that they just can't compete anymore.###.###yeah.###it's high dollar.	###even college is all can we get on t v###.###right.
166371:12	###sure.###.### and but,###.###well, i think they're starting --n402467 to realize that.###a lot of the, like the big eight teams that --n40252b used --n402536 to run so much. i think they're starting --n402569 to realize that they just can't compete anymore.###.###yeah.###it's high dollar.###you know, it's all, it's all money now.	###.###right.###.
166599:37	###now th-, that y-, s-, you can still,###yeah,###i've always done that.###i started,###once i found out that that's really not necessary or legal then i just refuse###and i say what are you going --n400c5b to do --n400c6a.###you going --n400cf5 to say you don't want --n400d18 to sell me this product then that's fine.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and then, ultimately, they say, no###you don't have --n400f53 to put it down.###but, uh, really it's part of this compliance thing.
166669:26	###uh-huh.###.###like, uh, national public radio or any of these, the public, uh, stations, you know.###.###uh-huh.###.### i, i, i, i think i sent in, in money for, f-, once to, uh, to public, uh, t v.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###huh.###.
166707:45	###.###how do you know that --n403783.###.### who, how do you know that --n4037ef.### why, why you even telling me this --n40388c.###is it any of your business.###i mean, it --n403983's one thing that i, and the college knows that###that's, just our business.###.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
166778:11	###and so i, you know, i guess most of the time when i think about somebody going into a nursing home --n401137, it's more a case of where they are not able --n40116e to look after their day-to-day needs --n40118d.###yeah###.###uh-huh.###.###they have can look after a lot of things###but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able --n401464 to deal with --n401477 physically anymore.###uh, i know my, none of my grandparents were in a nursing home.###they generally were able --n40165e to have someone care for them at home###and they died.	###like they were in their eighties. that type of thing.###uh, but i did, uh, you know,###i guess, uh, when i think nursing home --n401922 i do think of people that --n401941 are not able --n401954 to do, take care of themselves physically. uh,
166888:73	###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###and many times i've seen on trials they have --n401b7d on t v,###the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever,###but i think that it --n401d19 should be up to the judge and the, uh, lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be --n401d84.###.###um.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
166924:65	###at least in california, they're supposed --n402af6 to be.###not during the trial,###during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do --n402c01 with their background.###.###right.###.###but when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going --n402d40 to lay --n402d4f down --n402d5a, i think that, uh, that they should.###.###uh-huh.###.	###they get too boring.###.###uh-huh.
166935:45	###they get too boring.###.###uh-huh.###so, you, what you're saying --n4030bb is this, if there is the second offense, then you execute them.###.###well, if it's a second offense, the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense, because obviously, the rehabilitation process did not work the first time.###.###um.###.###so you got --n403389 to give them either more time in the system or a different process that --n4033c8 will hopefully work better.	###you give them the option of --n4036c8 working off their time --n4036df doing civil service sort of things.###.###what about, uh, white collar crimes like, uh, theft of trade secrets.
166992:31	###so i go outside the area for that.###and i think that it --n4017c9's not my responsibility to police myself and pay pennsylvania what they believe they are owed --n401818 --n40181f even though, you know, the revenue stream went to another state.### i don't, i don't think that that's my responsibility as a, as a conscientious consumer.###.### i, i'll agree it, it's not your responsibility### but, b-, is it --n401c1c also legal, for you to do that.###.###.### w-, w-, fr-, from what i understand --n401d32 from v-, v-, various net readings, i-, i-, it, the federal government is going --n401dc5 to try --n401dd4 to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years.### it is, it is a lost revenue stream right now	### with some, with something like that, d-, do your arguments still apply.###.###well, i think that if, if policy is established --n4023c7 --n4023ce and if a mechanism is put --n4023ed into place --n4023fc to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then i don't argue with it.
167014:30	###that's a cost of doing business.###the burden shouldn't be placed --n402b9a on the consumer.###.###and i, i i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having, having --n402c6c to pay sales tax on it.###.###.###uh.###.###that's my understanding of the way, uh, the way it works --n402e2f.###usually, the, the person ordering doesn't pay.	###and there r-, there are s-, some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try --n40317c to avoid that.###.###uh, do you mean businesses from the point of view as, of, of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax. or purchasing.
167041:37	###yeah.###see i'm unfamiliar with that because i don't, i never see that end of the business.###.###yeah.###.###so, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer.###uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for --n403e04 policing themselves, then i think some well defined mechanisms need --n403e3b to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity f-, to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided --n403eb6.###.###that's true.### i-, i-, a r-, a big hole does exist right now, uh, in that consumers can just say oh, i, i forgot that.	### and, and that it is a a l-, loss. i, i think --n404427 is that the federal government will try --n40444a to establish a mechanism ju-, just to do just that in or-, in order --n4044b5 to gain the revenue that --n4044d4's being lost --n4044e7.###uh, i mean, i, i don't know if i agree with that.### but it, but,
167135:12	###.###i suppose you could say, well that has something --n402a78 to do with potential for rehabilitation.###.###potential.###i mean that's, that's the key right there. potential.###.###uh-huh.###.###now, are they, are they rehabilitative or, or not.###.	###but if you're involved yourself, personally###.###uh-huh.
167235:10	### our one of our main problems was,###.###wow.###.###well in massachusetts, i thought i was going --n400da9 to,###well, it was a, a fun time###but i thought, gosh, summer time, you know.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###.###and one thing is that we're, we had, we were going --n401080 to pour the basement foundation.
167376:59	###.###uh-huh.###.### did t-, uh, did it go up and down.###.###uh-huh.###.###oh, i see.###.###yeah.	###.###uh-huh.###.
167494:30	###.###if we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here.###.###i see.###.###and we actually pull out the money --n4019c1 each month that we want --n4019dc to put --n4019eb in for birthdays, that we want --n401a0e to put --n401a1d in for, uh, the vacation. that we put --n401a50 in for christmas.###.###like you have a separate account for that then.###.###well, a lot of that, uh, i don't know how safe it is --n401ccb.	###.###oh, i see.###uh-huh.
167518:43	###.###each of our,###we have three children.###so they each have their own account.###.###i see.###.###that money is put --n4021ae into --n4021b9 each month.###.###uh-huh.	### th-, does he invest in that and for long-term.###.###he does somewhat.
167811:81	###yeah.###yeah.###i mean, i don't, i honestly don't really think i could have, you know, done much better than i did in the school system i was in --n40435d.###i mean.###.###yeah.###.###.### i, i, i, my schools, i mean, there,###i have a lot of	###.###yeah.###.
167822:62	###.###yeah.###.### that, i mean, that makes a big difference###cause i wondered when they're taking classes with, uh, with people that --n40495b are really, are interested in the, the subject and stuff like that --n4049a6.###.###yeah.###i mean, and and in the,###.###.	###well, no,###i guess it wa-, in junior high, it was still three.###then in high school it changed into four levels of, uh, of instruction in the major subjects. uh, which,
167836:20	###.###uh-huh.###.###i mean, actually i think that works pretty well.###mumblex and that, that makes,###.###.###mumblex.###.###well, here in logan, utah, we've got a nice little valley here	###and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley.###.###huh.
168125:160	###yeah.###.###yeah,###that's true.###i mean, up here, they give you one, one of those containers###and you put everything in it.###.###uh-huh.###.###so it's like, if, if you use a lot of stuff, you,	###.###uh-huh.###.
168218:22	###i don't if you ever listen to talk radio###but those guys, they just kind of get into, to s-, s-, stewing up trouble, you know. with the callers and things like that.###.###um, occasionally.###.###.###yeah.###.###but they get into some really good conversations sometimes, you know.###and some of it, sometimes it's serious	###and from --n404b4e listening to that, i kind of got an idea that i thought --n404b8d would be good with###.###yeah.
168237:31	###.###and it's like, uh,###.###.###your turn.###.###oh, i, i start.###okay.###well, uh, we keep a budget to an extent.###uh, and really, i-, i-, we were really forced --n4001a5 into --n4001b0 keeping a budget because i'm, i'm paid once a month which --n4001fb sort of, sort of forces some, uh, uh, restrictions	###uh, about yourself.###.###well, i have --n40056a to say i really don't have a budget.
168358:9	###uh, my wife,###and then, we're, we're having one on the way in, uh, in, uh, september.###.###so how,###.### you, whe-, once you get ten children though, you may have,###.###no###i think it's just going --n403089 to be one.###.	###.###speakerb46-1*t46-1.###how about yourself.
168372:15	###speakeranan*t46-1.###speakera46-2*t46-2.###i have two kids.###speakerbnan*t46-2.###speakera47-1*t47-1.###uh, one nine and one thirteen###oh.###and they are beginning --n40326b to be a budget problem but, uh, have not been really up until this, up to this point.###speakerbnan*t47-1.###speakerb47-2*t47-2.	###speakeranan*t47-2.###.###i mean do you have them on an allowance.
168551:36	###and i couldn't pull the switch###but, uh,###.###well actually i, wha-,###the other thing that --n4030e6 bothers me is when it becomes a political issue --n403111 because i don't really think it, uh, i don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else.###i think it just becomes a, uh, symbolic i'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians###so###.###yeah.###.	###.###right.###.
168792:42	###.###so, uh, what things do you consider --n400036 an invasion of privacy.###.###ooh, well i don't know.###what do you think --n40013e.###.###oh, i don't know.###i had a little bit more time --n4001fa to think about it --n400211.###i was thinking of, like, uh,###i don't know,	###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.
168792:82	###.###so, uh, what things do you consider --n400036 an invasion of privacy.###.###ooh, well i don't know.###what do you think --n40013e.###.###oh, i don't know.###i had a little bit more time --n4001fa to think about it --n400211.###i was thinking of, like, uh,###i don't know,	###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.
168792:115	###.###so, uh, what things do you consider --n400036 an invasion of privacy.###.###ooh, well i don't know.###what do you think --n40013e.###.###oh, i don't know.###i had a little bit more time --n4001fa to think about it --n400211.###i was thinking of, like, uh,###i don't know,	###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.
168792:220	###.###so, uh, what things do you consider --n400036 an invasion of privacy.###.###ooh, well i don't know.###what do you think --n40013e.###.###oh, i don't know.###i had a little bit more time --n4001fa to think about it --n400211.###i was thinking of, like, uh,###i don't know,	###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.
168855:141	###yeah,### and and, uh, of course, the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't,###.###.### it, uh, it destroys their libido.###.###yeah, tha-, that would be kind of an extreme.###.###now, uh, you know if they ever,###.	###.###so what about that as an invasion of privacy.###.
169310:18	###what am i trying --n400bb2 to say --n400bc1. uh,###.###.###i do learn about things. largely from friends###.###uh-huh.###huh.###.###and i occasionally will read something like the new york review of books.###you know, someone will write a book about something	###.###uh-huh.###.
169331:61	###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, i guess you could explain it two ways.	###and the view that i would rather take --n401ab1 is that there's a different amount of information you need --n401ae8 when you're particularly interested in a topic or, uh, particularly interested in --n401b2b buying something as a, you know as a hobbyist --n401b5a versus when you want --n401b71 to go out and buy a blender because you need --n401ba0 to mix things --n401bb3.###.###uh-huh.
169468:39	###.###uh-huh.###.###and seems to me that that's, i think that's the way it's done --n400870 now --n40087b.###uh, at least, my understanding of the law which --n4009c3 isn't very good.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, it seems to me that the judge does it	###.###uh-huh.###.
169547:32	###something inexpensive.###.###yeah.###yeah,###exactly.###uh, i guess, kind of the way i think about it --n402332 also, is they just,###.###.###if somebody gets the death penalty, they're, they're judged --n402462 guilty,###they got the death penalty,	###and if not, you know, don't, don't let them sit up there on death row for, you know, fifteen years.###.###yeah.
169618:51	###six months so far they said --n403887.###.###yeah.###probably.###.###so.###.###yeah.###probably.###you know, i'm not sure there's a number.	###.###maybe they could go with a, with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their, uh, vote.###.
169618:59	###six months so far they said --n403887.###.###yeah.###probably.###.###so.###.###yeah.###probably.###you know, i'm not sure there's a number.	###.###maybe they could go with a, with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their, uh, vote.###.
169686:53	###uh, i don't know of anyone who --n40036c ever has been picked --n400383 out and been tested --n40039a.###.###so it's just sort of, uh,###they can if they,###.###they can if they choose --n400551 to.###.###oh, okay.###.###right.	###.###uh, not really###but i've always worked on a university level
169895:249	###.###yeah.###well i, i don-, i don't know.### we, we --n40192d also, my wife and i, uh, uh, volunteer --n401964 to go to a, uh, nursing home that --n401993's just a mile from our house.### we, uh, she goes more often than i.###we used --n401bb3 to go once a month, once every two months --n401be2 to visit some of the patients there.###and we'd take, we have a two year old son###and so we, sometimes we'd take him with us.###and, uh, there i would say it's the same thing.### it's, it's a nice, uh, relatively nice environment	###it --n4024d8's, must be depressing to, to walk, walk the halls and see, an-, and see all these other people who --n40256b really don't know where they are --n40258e.###.###do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with --n4027a3, that the people who --n4027be operate it seem --n4027d1 to have, what you'd perceive of --n4027f8 as genuine concern.
169896:107	###yeah.###well i, i don-, i don't know.### we, we --n40192d also, my wife and i, uh, uh, volunteer --n401964 to go to a, uh, nursing home that --n401993's just a mile from our house.### we, uh, she goes more often than i.###we used --n401bb3 to go once a month, once every two months --n401be2 to visit some of the patients there.###and we'd take, we have a two year old son###and so we, sometimes we'd take him with us.###and, uh, there i would say it's the same thing.### it's, it's a nice, uh, relatively nice environment###but again, um, it must be depressing for the people who, who --n402040 are, who --n402057 are just e-, e-, essentially not able --n40209e to take care of themselves in their own house but, but, certainly, uh, certainly have ar-, ar-, are, have retained all of their, uh, mental skills and so on.	###.###do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with --n4027a3, that the people who --n4027be operate it seem --n4027d1 to have, what you'd perceive of --n4027f8 as genuine concern.###.
169924:30	### it, it's possible,###i was thinking also that there'd be, there could be a fair burn out factor um, in just having --n4034d1 to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes, depending on the person, not going --n403524 to be what we would perceive of --n403547 as rational need --n40355a.###.###oh, yeah.###.###.###yeah.###i'll tell you one thing --n4037e7 --n4037ee though that --n403805'll, that, that i, i saw --n403840 that --n40384b was really nice.###we saw a husband and wife,###we used --n403a21 to see a husband and wife in there, uh, together	###but these two were.###.###uh-huh.
169929:39	###.###yeah.###i'll tell you one thing --n4037e7 --n4037ee though that --n403805'll, that, that i, i saw --n403840 that --n40384b was really nice.###we saw a husband and wife,###we used --n403a21 to see a husband and wife in there, uh, together###and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were --n403b0b###but these two were.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###so it gives them a sense of identity.
169942:51	###so it gives them a sense of identity.###.###and so,###.###.###yeah,###you walked in there###and it didn't look like, uh, you know, how, yo-, you, you walk into some rooms --n403e58 and there's, it's completely generic.###there's nothing, maybe a picture or two that --n404022 belongs to that person###and that's it.	###and they had all their stuff from their house###and it looked like, uh, i-, i-, it must have been,###it --n4043f0 was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them
169943:13	###.###and so,###.###.###yeah,###you walked in there###and it didn't look like, uh, you know, how, yo-, you, you walk into some rooms --n403e58 and there's, it's completely generic.###there's nothing, maybe a picture or two that --n404022 belongs to that person###and that's it.###but this room, on the other hand, you know, they got rid --n404149 of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that	###and it looked like, uh, i-, i-, it must have been,###it --n4043f0 was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them###and it must also give them a sense of, uh, uh, security and, and, uh, and, and, you know, s-, s-, uh,
169988:20	###okay.###.###how are you --n400038.###you want --n40007e to go ahead and start --n400099 talking about whether you budget.###.###yes.###yeah.###well i-, i, i, i feel like, uh, i am from mars.###i mean i'm fifty years old###and, uh, i've been divorced for, um, eighteen years.	###but i, uh, i, i've never had a budget###and i don't, uh, do any planning###and i don't know,
170249:102	###but i mean the company as a whole###because you as an employee,###even the company is making money,###they paying you a salary###but you are responsible for that company growth.###you're responsible --n40258c also for --n40259b helping that company get to the par-, point that it's at --n4025d6 at --n4025e1 making profits.###so there should be something --n402725 in there or some kind of clause that --n40274c will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that.###.###uh-huh.###.	###i don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of com-, a company situation --n402bcb.###.###now how do you mean that --n402d59.
170265:111	###well in a sense that say, how do you make a, a conclusion that you're going --n402e3c to lay off these ten people. uh, for the bad times of the company --n402e83.###.###uh-huh.###.###what about the, the work effort those ten people did --n40302b when the company was doing well --n40304a.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know. in that standpoint.###.	###or,###.### ye-, yes,
170279:72	###i do.###.###uh-huh.###.###i really do.###i think it'd be better that way###and even at that, it would at least give the person time to look for another job --n403594 because they know that mumblex that there are problems###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###yeah.###.
170375:14	###.###and i was, i was the youngest.###.###yeah.###.###so i understand how that worked --n401040.###and he was treated --n4010af like he had five fathers or something.###.###right.###that's exactly how it is --n40117d, you know.	###when things don't go right --n4012f4, she just calls one of them, you know.###.###yeah.
170382:32	###.###right.###that's exactly how it is --n40117d, you know.###she's got all these sisters and her brother --n401233 to take care of her.###when things don't go right --n4012f4, she just calls one of them, you know.###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, yeah,### it, it's a little bit difficult, though.	###and,###.###did you all do a lot of organized things like, uh, little league, uh, soccer.
170385:8	###she's got all these sisters and her brother --n401233 to take care of her.###when things don't go right --n4012f4, she just calls one of them, you know.###.###yeah.###.###but, uh, yeah,### it, it's a little bit difficult, though.###i think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and i was home more --n40152d.###and,###.	###.### we, we really did not.###my next oldest daughter that --n4017b6's in college in california is a world twirling champion.
170395:13	###did you all do a lot of organized things like, uh, little league, uh, soccer.###.### we, we really did not.###my next oldest daughter that --n4017b6's in college in california is a world twirling champion.###she twirls a baton###and we did a lot of things together.###.###uh-huh.###.###she and i did a lot of things together and flew,	###.###uh-huh.###.
170401:25	###.###uh-huh.###.###she and i did a lot of things together and flew,###we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform.###.###uh-huh.###.###and that was a lot of fun.###but that, that, i guess you could consider that organized.	###.###yeah.###.
170451:27	###.###yeah.###well i know i spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter###and my little one also competed because really she had no choice.###she had --n4028c0 to go with me.###.###uh-huh.###.###so the three of us just spent a lot of time --n402975 traveling and, and competing###and, of course, the competing itself, really --n402a76 didn't matter what it was --n402a95,	###and it was a really neat experience,###but it took our total time.###i did not work, uh, when i did this --n402cb4.
170581:13	###yeah.###we used --n400b6e to have a honda accord###and they're good.###they're really good cars.###every time i get taken --n400c7e to an auto repair place --n400c99, you know, every time i go --n400cc4, i get taken --n400cdb.###bad you know.###.###huh.###.###woman goes in	### let's ge-, see how much money we can get --n400f37 out of her, you know.###.###huh.
170694:54	###well that's wonderful.###.###yeah.###.###you're lucky.###.###yeah,###i am,###so, i don't know.###i don't know what the solution to that is --n403542	###we took our honda to the honda dealership###and they ended up --n403727 telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car.###.
170726:57	###but i, my grandparents were looking into it before###so i know what they've said --n400228.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh-huh.###.###well, i'm trying --n4002d8 to think.###my, uh, uh, wife's grandmother had alzheimer's###and they were going --n4003d6 to put her into a, a nursing home	###and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a, a, you know, a, a nuisance. or worse than a nuisance,###i mean she sort of went, you know, bananas###.
170776:44	###yeah.###.###they need health care###so they're already ill before they go.###.###right.###.###that's probably a large factor.###.###yeah.	###then you only go there as a last resort.###.###uh-huh.
170799:47	###.###so that was their thinking.###somebody who --n40233d would know what to do --n40235c in the event of an emergency.###.###right.###.###and also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed --n402472 while they still had choices to make --n40249d. so they wouldn't be stuck --n4024c0 going into just whatever nursing home --n4024df was available at the time.###.###right.###.	###.###yeah,###i guess.
170848:30	###.###yeah.###well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing --n4034fa.###.###it --n40363b's just a shame that's the way it has --n403672 to be --n403681.###i think the retirement home idea's a nice idea.### to go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay --n403820###.###yeah.###.	###.###right.###.
170861:11	###.###.###yeah,###i've known quite a few people that --n403af1 have, uh, gone to retirement communities.###i don't know if they have them back there###but here in california and in ari-,###.###.###uh, i've had, uh, three boys --n40003a through, i guess, uh, some child care, each one of them###and now they're in school	###but, uh, i guess i would say it --n40020e's not easy to find wha-, what most parents would want --n400249.###.###well i can profit by this because i'm due with my first in about three months.
170937:84	###.###i don't think it's as common as, uh, the newspapers would make you believe.###.###uh-huh.###and another thing is cost.###.###oh, yeah.###i mean that,###.###i know so many of my friends i went to school with --n401ff6 who --n402001 are having babies right now	###.###right.###.
170991:19	###.###but i think, you know, you have --n4033ce to look through a place###and you have --n403491 to get a feel for, uh, how they treat the kids --n4034cc and, uh, uh, what kind of staff members they have --n403507 and how much turnover they have --n403526 and things like that before you commit your child to them.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i think you have, the main thing is that you have --n403788 to determine that they're perfectly open. that you're welcome anytime without notice, in the middle of the day and so forth	###yeah.###.###you have --n403a5e to start --n403a6d wondering if they don't want you.
171125:14	###so that's good.###that's an interesting point.###but i just think our, our family lives have changed drastically.###.###.###and i think that's ju-,###of course a part of it is technology.###i mean our kids, where would they be --n402301 without nintendo and, you know, their t v shows###and no-,###some of that is really bad i think --n40243e.	###so many single families now.###uh, a lot of working,###both parents are working.
171201:121	###.###and they've got their homes###and they've got,###.###.###why don't you go ahead and start --n400032.###.###okay.###well i think the court systems could stand some improvement.###uh, trial by jury is good	###and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence --n400641 is beyond me.###i don't know.###.
171201:163	###.###and they've got their homes###and they've got,###.###.###why don't you go ahead and start --n400032.###.###okay.###well i think the court systems could stand some improvement.###uh, trial by jury is good	###and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence --n400641 is beyond me.###i don't know.###.
171245:62	###uh, well, actually i think in most criminal cases it --n4013ad wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury.### what, what i worry about --n401507 is cases where it's the government against the individual --n401536.###that's where you really need a jury of peers --n40164d.###because, uh, anytime th-, the government, uh, is the government against the individual --n40172b you need som-, y-, you need the protection of ordinary citizens.###.###well, that's true.###.###i think that's really the only thing.###i guess where i would like --n4019d6 to see the system change --n4019f1 is,###uh, uh, there ought --n401ac3 to be a, a	###.###uh-huh.###.
171537:52	###.###uh-huh.###.###so it's a lot, it --n401212's very hard on a nonfixed income because i don't know how many days i'm going --n401261 to be called --n401274 in --n40127f and whether i am --n40129a or not, to try --n4012b9 to keep track of finances.###.###uh-huh.###.### and, but i know how much --n40150f i have --n40151e to bring --n40152d in a month.###and that's about it.###that's about as far as we go.	###.###uh-huh.###.
171564:33	###and my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support.###.###oh dear.###.###so right now i know what i'm getting --n401eea from the state###and, uh, i have --n401f90 to balance, more or less, what i get --n401fbf from the state with my bills and, uh, you know, try --n401ffe to work as many days as possible. any time they call me in --n402041.###.###uh-huh.###.###but i still have --n402220 to figure out.	###and if i don't work enough days then i don't get enough to meet the bills###and it's like a juggling act every single month.###.
171746:19	###but i have a boyfriend that --n401380 lives in fresno###.###do you,###.###and he is for the l, the, uh, raiders. l a raiders,###.###uh-huh.###.###so.###.	###.###well, i just started --n4015a6 to this year because of these silly raiders that --n4015d5 didn't do very well,###.
171756:21	###do you follow professional sports at all.###.###well, i just started --n4015a6 to this year because of these silly raiders that --n4015d5 didn't do very well,###.###.###but i've been trying more this year.###i think i know a little more than i use --n401752 to.###.###yeah.###.	###so i'm trying.###.###well, it's a good past time, you know.
171838:13	###uh-huh.###.###like they have this world football league.###you see,###we have the n f l that, that dallas and houston --n402f96 are in --n402fa5 and new england patriots and l a raiders and those teams.###.###yeah.###.###there are those teams that --n4030fd play in professional, national football league###but, uh, now they have what --n4031c1's called --n4031d0 the world football league	###there's a team in london###and there's a team there, there's, uh, teams, other european teams###.
171860:57	###and there's only so much football you can watch --n403653.###.###yeah.###well, i like --n403709 to do,###i don't like --n40377a to watch.###.###yeah,###that's good.###.###i don't like --n40383f to watch anything.	###i think it's an, excuse to do nothing --n403a03###.###.
171985:32	###.###so a judge, you're right --n400961, should have the whole dossier of the criminal there###.###uh-huh.###.###and if they're judged --n400a5d guilty would probably be in a better pri-, position to give an appropriate, uh, sentencing --n400ab8.###.###yeah.###see i agree with you.###uh, one thing i heard --n400c61 was this, where they have, instead of --n400c94 going to the regular court, they have a, a mock court --n400cd3.	###uh, you go###and you present your case,###the other side presents their case
171995:28	###i mean, it's supposed --n400e55 to be all legal and everything.###uh, you go###and you present your case,###the other side presents their case###and you're done with it.###it's almost like the night court we see --n40104f on t v.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, and, uh, but it's not that we have, uh, such,	###uh, so i,###that was one thing i thought about --n4013c7 that --n4013d2 would be really neat if we could do it that way.###.
171995:79	###i mean, it's supposed --n400e55 to be all legal and everything.###uh, you go###and you present your case,###the other side presents their case###and you're done with it.###it's almost like the night court we see --n40104f on t v.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, and, uh, but it's not that we have, uh, such,	###uh, so i,###that was one thing i thought about --n4013c7 that --n4013d2 would be really neat if we could do it that way.###.
172045:23	###because, i mean, gee whiz, if i was, uh, uh, didn't have that right, you know, not to have a jury that,###oh###yes,###i would feel, uh, you're right --n40229b, that my civil rights had been violated --n4022c2.###but i meant for some, when both parties agreed that yes, we're going --n4023c4 to have a judge here --n4023df.###we're not going --n4024d8 to have a jury, you know,### let's get it over with.###sort of like car accidents, you know,###.###right.	###.###yeah.###.
172080:118	###.###.###the take.###right.###.###yeah.###and i suspect it, in cases like,###i guess we were supposed --n402f9e to be doing criminals --n402fb5 though, rather than civil.###is that right.###.	###.###yeah.###.
172217:27	###.###i see.###.###yeah,###so.###.###in engineering.###.###yes, actually.###.	###.###yeah,###it, uh,
172255:55	###even the computer at work is primarily a, uh, word processing system and a communication system.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###yeah,###yeah.###do you use email and like that.###.###yes.	###.###yeah.###it's,
172264:47	###yes.###emil is, probably pulls down a third a-, of all my time.###.###yeah.###it's,### i, i, uh, i have modem mumblex night computer###so i can log into the sys-, the, uh, network at georgia tech and access my account through there, which is, which --n401e8c can be useful.###but, uh, yeah### that's, that and word processing is###while i tend --n4020c7 to,	###.###uh-huh.###.
172362:74	###no it's,###.###.### say what.###.###i just barely got home from the university.###.### tell you what we can do --n400569 is, uh, i can punch the, uh, one,###.###.	###.###okay,### go ahead,
172412:35	###.###but we have a pretty low income ta-, i mean pretty low tax rate here.###oh, i think the, the sales tax, they just got --n401634 to do something about it.###.###right.###.###but that's the politicalness of trying --n401765 to not create any new taxes.###.###right.###but i guess when i hear, when i see the comparison between the united states and, uh, any other western country --n40189c, uh, their, their rates are like, uh, forty-one, forty-two and ours are like thirty-six, thirty-seven, you know,	### t-, th-, there's no other country that --n401c36's, that --n401c49 is taxed --n401c58 as low as we are.###.###well and i still think that, having lived in europe for awhile, you know, difference in living conditions are certainly well worth, uh, what we pay --n401e4b for it.
172455:98	###i think the other problem is, you know, it, it --n40270f's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you, theoretically, can do something about --n402766.###.###right.###.###but i look, for example,###and you're not quite in the same situation###but like school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world.###.###right.###.	###.###right.###.
172474:19	###yeah,### that, that's probably a little tougher on you.###.### it's not, it's not quite the bargain that mumblex.###.###.###but, i mean, i pay them gladly.###that's a decision,###i think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like canada and england and germany do perfectly well with a, uh, two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools f-, with the same tax money --n403072.###but, uh, i mean, that's, that's the way americans want --n403259 to interpret it --n40326c,	###but,###yeah.###i,
172580:110	###.###uh, i guess that would be up there.###uh, i'm not sure if i would rank, uh, how i would rank that --n4012ac next to, say compared to retirement###or, uh, uh, uh, pretax savings was another thing that i think --n40143f is a a great, a great benefit mumblex.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.	###uh,###.###right.
172789:32	###.###uh, well, i th-,###no###i think that people that --n401e77 work for the government are just as against taxes as, as everybody else, you know.###unless you work for internal revenue.###.###yeah,###i belong.###.###.	###.###yeah.###.
172804:59	###like every, every time there is a, a bond issue --n40242f you know, i vote no on every one of them.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.### i'm, i,###but there, this is, this is, tax not tax revolt country.###i mean there's too many,	###.###yeah.###.
172920:50	###cab.###.###.###oh, yeah.###.###and so they just fit in there.###when they get --n40067a to be teenagers with long legs --n400699, it may not work.###.###yeah.###.	### and, uh and since i do a lot of projects, i throw things in the back###.###there you go --n4009c4.
172983:26	###but, uh, i, i guess, we had a small toyota wagon###.###.###right.###.###and we were real happy with that because, uh, my, my second requirement after price is, uh, low maintenance.###.###right.###.###and, uh, th-, it certainly had that.	###.###yeah.###.
173151:30	###.###right.### i i kind of like mine,###.###.###yeah,###so, mine's a ford.###.###a friend of mine just bought mumblex, bought like a year ago.### it, it's a really nice truck.	###but one of the dodges they have --n40527f out now has a, uh, the cummins turbo diesel on it.###.###oh, i heard about that,
173222:11	###and, uh, i have a preschooler.###uh, i was told --n4008cc by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten###and i thought well how mature do you have --n4009f6 to be --n400a05.###.###i know.###what's the new criteria --n400ad5, huh.###.###and, uh, there is a,###do you have the standardized testing now.###.	###and it's over and over.###it's i t b s or, and, uh, just everything, everything.###.
173363:38	###but i think it's a very long day.###.###oh, it is.###.###and my feeling is that, you know, you're only a kid once, and you don't want --n403239 to spend your whole life in school.###.###that's right.###.###.###my son said that, came home	###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.
173391:39	###.###wouldn't that be great.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###right.###.###and so i just find this a real problem.	###one of my daughters, once, was out of school with mono in her junior year i think it was --n403c56.###and she had a home teacher for like four hours a week###and when she went back in six weeks --n403de9, she was ahead.
173429:53	###i agree.###.###but i think that working parents have kind of demanded this.###.###i wouldn't be surprised.###.###you know, because they don't, they don't want --n4045dd to send them to daycare.###.###i doubt if they would say it was too long.###.	###.###uh, do you have the before school care --n4048a5, at your school and the after school care.###.
173489:40	###speakerbnan*t13-2.###.###the law enforcement community, uh, uh, you know, has to, has --n401cff to separate the difference between somebody who --n401d26 is being set --n401d39 up in which, uh, grievous acts are done --n401d68 --n401d6f to, uh, to, you know, to get somebody into a, a situation where they're going --n401dfe to be guilty of, of a crime --n401e25.### or whether, uh, an-, and whether the rights of that individual are been, have been, you know, impuned --n402205.###uh, but or whether there's just, you know, a policeman has just made a, uh, a, you know, a non, a noncritical error, though be it not the right way to do it --n402423###.###.### but, but, you know, the, the merits of the case in terms of, you know, the guy was a law breaker, as being supportive.###now, i, i'm, a-, a-, at this juncture### i, you know, i'm, i'm not sure, you know, what --n4029a6 constitutes a, a technicality.	###and that's what all these, you know, court cases are about --n402c94.###i mean our, uh, our, our glorious, uh, you know, mayor here in washington is six days away from --n402da5 getting out of, out of the can###and, uh, you know, he, he tried --n402f75 to appeal his conviction.

173526:115	###uh-huh.###.###.###and where his, old evidence was there, the witnesses were there, the, everything was conclusively pointing to this individual --n404866 yet,###.###.###uh, a lot of companies now are, are using, uh, drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to, to root out the, the either, uh, elementary or intermediate or advanced, uh, drug users.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###uh-huh.###.
173542:48	###.###.### and, and i, i feel as though, uh, that, uh, uh, you know, that if you, you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that --n400798's difficult unless you really go into a deep background.###of course, we're, we're,### being involved in my organization, uh, we, we have deep background checks### and and so, uh, but, but, sometimes, you know, drug use can, can escape that.###.###sure,###sure.###.	###.###huh.###.
173560:220	###.###yeah.###.###what's your, uh, feeling --n40152c.###.###uh, well i guess i, i guess i'm probably a little more to, toward the other direction.###.###.###uh, well i guess, mainly because, uh, it's, i,###well, like there's two sides to it i guess --n401813.	###uh, but i guess i feel more like whatever you're doing --n401d25 in your own private life is your own private business.###uh, and i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that, uh, things like drug laws seem --n401e94 to come and go.###you know, we had prohibition for awhile
173606:30	###oh, yeah.###sure.###well it goes back to that, again, if you look at prohibition.###i mean because it's illegal, it costs more.###if it was legal,###i mean, face it###you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what, ten or twenty dollars an ounce.###.### i, i i must admit that,###.	###and, you know, you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it.###.###yeah.
173606:86	###oh, yeah.###sure.###well it goes back to that, again, if you look at prohibition.###i mean because it's illegal, it costs more.###if it was legal,###i mean, face it###you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what, ten or twenty dollars an ounce.###.### i, i i must admit that,###.	###and, you know, you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it.###.###yeah.
173761:39	###now there seem --n402bd4 to be really three reasons for education.###one is education for civic duty.###one is education for economic reasons.###and one is education for civilization.###i mean and i think that one,###.###well i'm glad that you added that one.###yeah,###i think that one's significant.###.	###and then i quit and got disabused --n40307f of that notion.###but, uh, the, uh, uh, now the only thing people seem --n403140 to agree on --n403153 is that education is, uh, an economic enterprise --n403186 to train people for jobs.###and, uh, i'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is --n40336c.
173828:11	###so it was an hour, you know.###.###yeah.###.###but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever, telling them stories or reading to them.###.###what was the age difference --n4009cf --n4009d6 between the youngest and the oldest.###.###six years.###.	###.###yeah.###.
173917:55	###well that's good too.###.###.###yeah,###that's good that way too.###.###well, i decided that, you know, you need that once in awhile. that you, you need --n402443 to plan the quality time### and, and i do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have --n4025b3 to be there twenty-four hours a day.###.###yeah.	###.###yeah.###.
173986:17	###.###oh.###.###and that was always good time.###boy, we really got --n403598 to know the kids well.###.###i imagine.###and i imagine you still have a very close relationship with them.###.###oh, yeah.	###.###i,###.
174037:39	###.###yeah###and boy, they, they'd show up.###.###well i think that's great.###.###and we'd usually take notes###.###yeah.###.	###.###yeah.###.
174150:25	### if, if the judge was doing it himself, without any checks and balances who --n401719's --n401724 to say.###.###yeah.###.###.###it,###there would be much more of that.###.###yeah###no doubt.	###.###no.###but i. i tend --n4019a8 to follow it --n4019bb just to, just to know what --n4019de's going on.
174259:28	###well originally from chicago###but,###.###oh, okay.###i was just thinking### i wonder, i wonder how, how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and say --n403741 where i am --n403754 in minneapolis --n403763.###mumblex###.###i really,###.	###.###.###and louisiana is completely different cause it was based --n403a54 on the, what is it --n403a77, it's based --n403a8e on common law
174291:37	###but, uh,###.###yeah.###i'm not really sure how we could change the legal system --n4040e0 to make it better --n4040f7.###mumblex.###.###yeah.###it's,###there are too many big problems, you know.### there's, there's such a backlog of court cases right now.	###.###i know.###.
174314:7	###.###yeah.###.### i, i, i'm originally from florida###and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them, you know.###.###huh.###.### that's not a, that's not a good solution either.###.	###.###i'm not real sure what the,###.
174336:99	###.###uh, i suspect a lot of people, uh, uh, got, uh, turned --n4002f8 on by watching, watching those go off.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, very exciting.###.###yeah.###.###the, uh, uh,	###.###uh-huh.###.
174371:32	###the, uh, uh,###i used --n400c7f to think when i was, when i was younger --n400cba that, uh, by this time we'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now.###.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###.###uh, frustrating at times.###.###uh-huh.###.	###.###well, uh, yo-, i, uh, i'm kind of young.###i'm only twenty-two
174376:77	###.###uh, frustrating at times.###.###uh-huh.###.###i don't know what you think --n400f62 about all that.###.###well, uh, yo-, i, uh, i'm kind of young.###i'm only twenty-two###and so, uh, uh, i'm not, you know,	###.###uh-huh.###.
174450:16	###.###uh-huh.###.###speakera50-1*t50-1.###yeah.###speakerbnan*t50-1.###speakerb50-2*t50-2.###and they want --n402cef to do the research###speakeranan*t50-2.###.	###.###yeah.###.
174855:72	###they test you, uh, before they, before you start or before you even interview###.###right.###.###or,###.###uh, they essentially,###no###i sure don't, uh,### they essentially, uh, they essentially, uh, made me the offer and then, and then, uh, did the drug testing thing after that.	### and, and then, they essentially give you the offer###.###uh-huh.
175114:17	###but it is a problem. uh, especially in the inner schools, inner city.###.###yeah,###there is no denying that, that,###.###.###sure, you know.### teachers, you have --n402ea9 to admit that teachers have --n402ec4 to slow things down for people who --n402ee7 don't understand, especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school.###.###well,	###.###that's right,###you can't do that.
175154:8	###.###.###yeah.### i, i believe i was too.###.###uh,###.###.###uh-huh.###but, you're right, you know.	###.###uh-huh.###.
175216:14	###well, i, i feel the other thing too, uh,###they were saying, uh, you know, what new ways could y-, could it, you, you know, change the system --n400df8.### i, i really think that, uh, we spend a lot of time, uh, --n400f71 going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal,###.###.###i mean, i-, if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. if they have been caught --n401134, you know, point blank in the crime. there's, uh, no question###.###right.###.###it's beyond a reasonable doubt.	###i mean, you know, we've gone through this over and over again.###.###.
175253:34	###.###well plea bar-, plea bargaining is a different story.###.###well.###.###plea bargaining is something completely different.### that, that actually prevents trials. or at least speeds them up.###.###well, i know.###that's mumblex what i'm saying --n401d22.	###i mean, you know, people who --n401f21 commit, uh, crimes that they,###i don't know how it works exactly --n40202f###but you know, they get lesser sentences
175278:23	### yo-, you know what i'm saying --n40240f.###that w-, we don't have, uh, well a lot of states don't have capital punishment.###.###right.###.###and, uh i, i think they should.###.###we do.###.### i, and i think if a person is guilty of --n402722 taking someone's life and like you say, it's, it's, there's no doubt whatsoever. like drunk drivers that --n402799 kill people	###.###right.###.
175325:50	###and, i don't know.###uh, what would you do --n4034e0 --n4034e7 to change it. to make it better.###.###well, uh, the, the only### i can, i wa-, you know,###the, appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of --n40370f.###uh, a-, like i said, as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence, that's absurd.###there's no way that could work --n403931.###.###oh, yeah.	###.###uh, but,###.
175400:7	###that's really great.###.###uh-huh.###.###you know, i work for, uh, wes-, a bank, western financial.###.###uh-huh.###.###and, uh, they don't let me know really about anything that --n401055's going on.###even some of the immediate things that i need --n401141 to know --n401150, i don't know it until the next hour	###we're changing departments.###we're changing policies.###we're changing doing other kinds of things. which --n4013d4 to me is, is disturbing.
175439:34	### we're, we're now collaborating.###.###oh.###.###and mumblex###.###and it, it,###.###for two years we didn't. and, we, which --n4024c1 was a, kind of stupid.### but, uh, but our organization is doing something else t-, on monday.	###and every, all the other employees are going --n4028d0 to come around and see what sort of things we do --n402903. which i thought --n40291e was kind of interesting and, but, uh, but that, that sort, sort of thing.###.###yeah,
175440:18	###.###oh.###.###and mumblex###.###and it, it,###.###for two years we didn't. and, we, which --n4024c1 was a, kind of stupid.### but, uh, but our organization is doing something else t-, on monday.###uh, we're having a, for all unclassified programs, we're, we're having little tables put --n40272e up in front of mumblex lab in the hallways	###.###yeah,###that is interesting.
175495:23	###uh-huh.###yeah.###.###and in thirty years it becomes pretty critical.###i mean, my, uh, brother-in-law is like, uh, i mean he's sixty.###he's not ready --n404900 to retire###but his company is, is, uh, is, uh, closing up.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and he's not ready --n404c94 to retire.###.###yeah,
175495:42	###uh-huh.###yeah.###.###and in thirty years it becomes pretty critical.###i mean, my, uh, brother-in-law is like, uh, i mean he's sixty.###he's not ready --n404900 to retire###but his company is, is, uh, is, uh, closing up.###.###uh-huh.###.	###and he's not ready --n404c94 to retire.###.###yeah,
175527:45	###uh, no###i wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means.###uh, you know, i would,### there, there's a lot of times --n4007cb though, uh, you get those calls and, you know, when you're sitting at home wanting --n400832 to relax or, or whatnot --n400851 --n400858###and, you know, next thing you know --n400a4f, uh, someone calls and wants --n400a72 to sell you this or that###and it --n400b7a's real hard to, to tell them, you know, that you're not interested.###or you do tell them you're not interested###and they still keep --n400d4c asking you, you know, and keep --n400d73 badgering you about it,###and that aggravates me.###but i don't know that you could call that invading of, invading my privacy	###.### but, but that doesn't work.###.
175697:17	###.###.###uh-huh.###.###and i was thinking in the course of talking to him about it, how, uh, in world war two, the personalties of stalin, hitler and churchill more or less defined the war --n40153e###and actually when you think back on the big events of the war --n4016a2, it was, uh, it was almost a personal struggle among these three,###uh, i guess you'd have --n40181d to call them great men in some sense.###.###uh-huh.###.	### and, uh, and, uh, with their nations pretty, pretty solidly behind each one of them.###.###yeah.
175744:65	### you knew, you knew who --n403008 was good.###you knew who --n4030b4 was bad.###.###yeah.###.###and it was a, it was a traditional m-, the traditional battle of, kind of good versus evil, if you, you know whichever way it is --n4031d2.###.###well you're not,###.###but in, in the vietnam war it seems like it was,	### and and, uh, you know, the,###.###it's ambivalent,
175945:80	###and it's unlike the fairly controlled, uh, press conferences that presidents of the united states have --n404e6c here where they, they always seem,###.###yeah.###.###.###budgeting activity in our household i, has is, uh, uh, kind of an informal kind of situation.### we, we, you know, put,###actually what --n4001fc happens is, uh, is, my check gets automatically deposited --n400237.###i don't even have the glories of --n400325 bringing home my check anymore.###it just gets deposited --n4003db.	###.###.### and, you know, and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them. you see,
175948:30	###.###.###budgeting activity in our household i, has is, uh, uh, kind of an informal kind of situation.### we, we, you know, put,###actually what --n4001fc happens is, uh, is, my check gets automatically deposited --n400237.###i don't even have the glories of --n400325 bringing home my check anymore.###it just gets deposited --n4003db.### and, and, and my, my wife, you know, you know, looks at all those bills that --n400492 come in###.###.	###and so our, our budgeting,### w-, we really don't have a formal budgeting situation.###every time i've ever tried one --n40085f, it's, uh, i've just got wrapped --n400892 in my inertia.
175967:64	###uh, at a certain point in life###an-, my husband, my ex-husband was an alcoholic.###and we got divorced --n400d69 back in the mid-seventies###and that left me with three teenagers.###.###you know, well a-, a-, actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets. isn't it.###.###it certainly is.###.###.	###i didn't rip them up.###i didn't send them back.###nothing.
175980:33	###nothing.###i just put them away.###because there was one that it --n401260 was really handy to have --n40127f.###if i absolutely had --n40133f to have something, i could go --n401362 use it.###.###uh-huh.###.###but, uh, mostly we just spent cash. whatever we had --n401465.###and if we didn't have it, we absolutely didn't spend it.###but then, as things improved, you know.	###my parents came through the depression.###i'm not sure how old you are --n4017e5.###.
176040:12	### but, but we also have zero in-, interest being paid --n402a5e.###and we pay it off as, as it goes.###.###uh-huh.###and that's the way i do my credit cards now --n402c05.###.###yeah.###so we never really get that much over, uh, over extended --n402cdc.###.###yeah.	###.###huh.###.
176070:67	### bu-, but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've, we've had two kids --n403547 in college that --n40355a just have graduated in the past year.###.###uh-huh.###.###so we're, you know, we don't have that.###.###it's time for you to do these things then. right.###.###yeah,### it's, uh, it's about time that we did that --n4038cd.	###and it all looks still pretty good to me.### why, why we need --n403b4e to replace it.###.
176071:10	###.###uh-huh.###.###so we're, you know, we don't have that.###.###it's time for you to do these things then. right.###.###yeah,### it's, uh, it's about time that we did that --n4038cd.###but, th-, the, the terrible part about it. i've looked at it all	### why, why we need --n403b4e to replace it.###.###.
176101:6	###you know, i, i, i don't spend that much money.### i just, uh, we just sort of have had, uh, you know, too many obligations --n40463a to, you know,###we sort of take care of the kids when they were school --n40479d###and they, they got through school.###and that was the major, you know, decade of expenses, you know.###so we, we feel as, uh,###but as far as any formal budgeting, uh, you know, i, i, we just apparently have been very fortunate.###when we went, want --n404b86 to go out --n404b99 to eat --n404ba8, we go out --n404bbf to eat.###we never really, you know, have --n404ce8 to program money for that or make choices, you know.###but, uh, we don't have that uproarious a, a lifestyle.	###.###.###okay.
176197:59	### and, and then i have my, uh, uh, i have a seven month old granddaughter###and, uh, her mother stays home###and she, they live, they live with us. you know, in, as orange county is really expensive.###.###uh-huh.###.###.###uh-huh.###.###they live with us	###but, uh, uh, she just,###uh, she used --n4019ff to work in pre, in the preschool and, and, and child care###and she says after working in there
176242:20	### th-, then i had one job###and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job.### and then, and then like about, later i, i tried --n4027ed to get the baby to a baby-sitter.###supposed to be good, uh, recommended person from the church###and i knew her personally.###she had two kids of her own and everything.###but i quit my job because i couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child --n402ad2.###.###uh-huh.###.	###so when my son stayed over there --n402c92, he got sick.###.###he got sick,
176242:41	### th-, then i had one job###and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job.### and then, and then like about, later i, i tried --n4027ed to get the baby to a baby-sitter.###supposed to be good, uh, recommended person from the church###and i knew her personally.###she had two kids of her own and everything.###but i quit my job because i couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child --n402ad2.###.###uh-huh.###.	###so when my son stayed over there --n402c92, he got sick.###.###he got sick,
176257:56	###.### same thing, same thing that the, her kids had --n402dae, right.###.###right.###well,###.###and so, uh, we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock.###then he, she'd take my son and her daughter over t-, to kindergarten.###but s-,###that day, uh, i was saying now he, he's sick.	###that's what he got --n4032d7, you know.### goes, well, okay,###so it's not like he's going --n4033db to infect her kids.
176284:24	### guess so,###yeah.###.###and then what --n403a61 happened was, is, you know, they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter.### called her###and they said, uh, that he's sick.###well she wasn't home.###.###huh.###.	###but she wasn't home, right.### and her, and her, her daughter that --n403e34 was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick.###now why didn't he, why didn't she keep him home with her --n403fdd.
176297:51	###now why didn't he, why didn't she keep him home with her --n403fdd.###no,###she didn't do that.###so, it got to the point where he's, he's supposed --n40413c to get out of, uh, kindergarten like about two thirty --n404173.###and i had --n4042a4 to leave work.### it was, it was five o'clock in the evening###and i found out he was still there at school.###and they were calling me###and they said somebody's got --n4044b7 to pick him up.###and i kept --n40455f thinking that she was going to get picked up, she was going --n4045a6 to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school.	###and he had a hundred and four fever.###they couldn't, uh, give him anything because they're not allowed --n40493c to at school and everything.###.
176324:77	###.###yeah.### when, when our kids were small --n404ea4 we had a couple of, uh, good, good women who, uh, --n404ef7 would often c-, uh, get them to come to the house.###.###.###okay.###well, uh, i'll let you start, i guess --n400060.###.###well, uh, yeah,### i, i'm employed --n40014e by a company that --n400165 does do, uh, random drug testing	###what about you.###are you, uh, in-, involved at all.###.

176371:40	###the constitution doesn't apply.###but i, it, it seems to me that it still should.### i, i, our company's doing it because they're a, uh, government contractor.###uh, and so it's, it's required for certain, some form, some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts###and i'd, i'd,###.###so it's the government that --n401e3a's mandating it to a certain extent..###.###yes.###okay.	###say,###okay, uh,###first off we don't, we don't have enough courage to, uh, pick out the people that, that --n4020a0 have some sort of indication of possible drug usage, uh, because that would offend them, uh, if they, if they weren't.
176375:47	###and i'd, i'd,###.###so it's the government that --n401e3a's mandating it to a certain extent..###.###yes.###okay.### an-, and our company has taken that and gone all the way.###say,###okay, uh,###first off we don't, we don't have enough courage to, uh, pick out the people that, that --n4020a0 have some sort of indication of possible drug usage, uh, because that would offend them, uh, if they, if they weren't.	###.###.###uh, and and, uh
176393:80	###well, i-,###.###then, uh,### but and they,###so it's, a, a complete random testing### w-, well it's random in the sense that you don't know when.###it is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested --n40273e.###.###huh.###.	### it, it, uh, certainly has no life threatening, uh, capabilities uh, you know, in, in my job.###.###right.
176466:60	###i'm not in the middle of anything.###i've just,###about the last thing i did --n400163###about maybe, oh, close to a year ago now i guess, i, i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house.###so, i guess that,###.###the whole thing.###.###yeah.### that, that was fairly large undertaking.	###.### did the framing and all.###.
176468:17	###about the last thing i did --n400163###about maybe, oh, close to a year ago now i guess, i, i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house.###so, i guess that,###.###the whole thing.###.###yeah.### that, that was fairly large undertaking.### a, a, it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house.###.	###.###oh, we did it all except for the sheetrocking.###.
176470:19	###so, i guess that,###.###the whole thing.###.###yeah.### that, that was fairly large undertaking.### a, a, it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house.###.### did the framing and all.###.	###.###huh.###.
176479:12	###.###oh, we did it all except for the sheetrocking.###.###huh.###.###that was the only thing we didn't, you know, putting the ceiling up and things like that### we don't, we, we weren't sure how to do that --n40080e###and.###.###maybe you and i should get together. because when i had my last big project --n40094b, i had the contractor do the framing	###.###yeah,###that's the exact opposite.
176483:39	###.###that was the only thing we didn't, you know, putting the ceiling up and things like that### we don't, we, we weren't sure how to do that --n40080e###and.###.###maybe you and i should get together. because when i had my last big project --n40094b, i had the contractor do the framing###and i did all the sheetrocking and the interior work.###.###yeah,###that's the exact opposite.	###we just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work###and that's it because you have, you know, get those joints to go together###.

176489:108	###and i did all the sheetrocking and the interior work.###.###yeah,###that's the exact opposite.###we did all, put the roof up and did all the roofing and the, put all the interior walls up.###we just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work###and that's it because you have, you know, get those joints to go together###.###ye-,###.	###.###yeah.###.
176545:28	###.### a-, and you knew how, you knew how to do the framing --n401e3f.###.###uh, well my dad knew how to do most of it --n401f59, you know.###.###uh-huh.###.### he, he'd, we'd gotten a couple of books###and then he just started --n402142 doing it.###i don't know.	###he put the whole, the whole floor in###and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there.###and then we were, put a, like a, not, not necessarily a garage, but just like a, off the side of that
176628:74	###yeah,###those are nice.###especially when you get done --n4036ed, you've got something, you know.###i don't know,###i like them.###you just sit down on on the deck and do whatever. have a barbecue###.###yeah.###.###.	###.###or,###.
176671:54	###.###so, yeah.###that's,###.###it's, uh, not that expensive.###i think it cost me three dollars a square foot and, uh, you know, no less than that.###.###yeah.###that's not,###.	###.###yeah,###that's good.
176675:17	###it's, uh, not that expensive.###i think it cost me three dollars a square foot and, uh, you know, no less than that.###.###yeah.###that's not,###.### co-, cost me about five hundred dollars, six hundred dollars all together.###.###yeah,###that's good.	### didn't have --n4045ad to,###.###yeah.
176684:68	###that's good.###that's not bad at all.### didn't have --n4045ad to,###.###yeah.###.### th-, the wood may###it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is --n4046b5, you know.### to get, to get good lumber it costs,###i don't know about dallas,	###i was surprised.###.###i'd be surprised if it wasn't, uh, cheaper where you are --n404a20.
176703:36	###.###yeah,###yeah,### that it probably does.###.###most.###.### i, i'm not sure###but,###.	###.###yeah.###it's nothing but woods up here, down here.
176743:20	###so.###.###yeah,###my current project is a walkway which i'm building --n405679 --n405680 around the house and out to the backyard to, uh, you know, --n4056c3 digging it out and laying sand and putting, uh, pavers on top of that###so.###.###yeah.###.###that's a lot easier.###.	###.###.###uh, with regard to, uh, to jury trials. i, you know, i, i really feel as though, uh, jury trials are, are, uh, whatever system --n4000de has been, been used --n400109 historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the, the only kinds of things that you can use --n400174. because the, the jurisprudence is, you know, based on, on, uh, you know, on accumulated n-, body of law.
176747:69	###so.###.###yeah.###.###that's a lot easier.###.###you've got something going all the time.###.###.###uh, with regard to, uh, to jury trials. i, you know, i, i really feel as though, uh, jury trials are, are, uh, whatever system --n4000de has been, been used --n400109 historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the, the only kinds of things that you can use --n400174. because the, the jurisprudence is, you know, based on, on, uh, you know, on accumulated n-, body of law.	###.###mumblex.###.
176747:138	###so.###.###yeah.###.###that's a lot easier.###.###you've got something going all the time.###.###.###uh, with regard to, uh, to jury trials. i, you know, i, i really feel as though, uh, jury trials are, are, uh, whatever system --n4000de has been, been used --n400109 historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the, the only kinds of things that you can use --n400174. because the, the jurisprudence is, you know, based on, on, uh, you know, on accumulated n-, body of law.	###.###mumblex.###.
176760:117	###.###so i, i really don't think it, they can really do much of anything --n400a9e to change it.###what do you think --n400bd6..###.###uh, i, i don't think so.###possibly in the jury selection would be the only,###.###.###just for example, what we're seeing --n400d55 in california i guess --n400d6c.###it makes you wonder, uh, had the jury been a different group of people what --n400e58 would have happened with that outcome.	###.###well won't,###well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that
176807:109	###that's right.###.###with everybody with that mind set. they, they're they're going --n401d48 to, that whole area is going --n401d73 to be turned --n401d8a into residential ghetto, you know,###.###they're only going --n401f4c to suffer.###.###and you might even be able --n401fcb to, to use it for, for a bombing test site, you know.###.### t-, they're only going --n402135 to suffer.### they, they've defeated themselves with, with their looting and violence.	###and, uh,###.###well e-, everybody is saying this is going --n40257e to be a new era
176920:36	###uh, yes###i do as far as, uh, as far as, uh, as far as immigration as a whole goes.###.###uh-huh.###.###i think that, uh, we simply must start --n4002b9 accepting everybody in the world.###.###uh-huh.###.###uh, i,	###we don't have jobs now.### i, i think, uh, i think when we come to a time of recession --n40053f that it --n40054e's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time.###uh, i hope you're one of the employed right now.
177032:19	###.###i think, probably your, a great deal of what you say --n40372f is true about the legals.###.###.###right.###.###but, uh, the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting --n40387e now, they do not come here --n4038a1 to blend into america.###.###.###uh, they, they don't bother --n4039cc to learn our language	###i'm sorry, this, i really feel strongly about this.###.###uh-huh.
177058:61	###.###.###but i gather you do not separate, uh, the bottles and cans.###.###no,### they, they do that on the truck.###.###uh-huh.###.###they separate them as they, as they, you know, dump them.	###and i think they're, they're running out of, uh, you know, mumblex.###the sanitary landfill, i think --n400c60, uh, is, you know, running out.###of course, uh, you being from new mexico, you've probably been n-, to washington. especially if you're, your present location.
177071:20	###of course, uh, you being from new mexico, you've probably been n-, to washington. especially if you're, your present location.###.###yes.###.###you must have come to washington at least once.###.###yes,###i know.###not only have i come to washington but, uh, i find it --n400fc3 very amusing that, uh, the thing that --n400fee was just instituted --n401001 here is very similar.###that is we also have blue bins.	###and, uh, landfill space is, in deed, the driving factor here.###and, in fact, uh, despite all of our open space out here, landfill space is still, uh, very hard to come by --n401408.###.
177073:25	###yes.###.###you must have come to washington at least once.###.###yes,###i know.###not only have i come to washington but, uh, i find it --n400fc3 very amusing that, uh, the thing that --n400fee was just instituted --n401001 here is very similar.###that is we also have blue bins.###we also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which --n4011dc goes into the bin and gets separated --n4011ff in the truck###and, uh, landfill space is, in deed, the driving factor here.	###.###my, you've got a lot a, a lot of nothing out there. you know,###.
177099:49	###uh, other, other than nuking it.###.###yes,###other than nuking it.###.###.###um, in fact, los alamos, uh, has, uh, done a fair amount of research, uh, in recycling things in general.###um, it, it involves, for instance, uh, creating biological organisms which --n401f2e can remove heavy elements like selenium, and barium and, uh, other things from, uh, waste material in general. and, uh, and purify the waste of specific, uh, uh, nasty elements.###.###well, isn't that a, that's a, that's pretty, uh, upscale, uh, trash, uh, uh, situation.	###.###.###and the thing that --n402502 just was in the local news bulletin was, somebody has, uh, ter-, made some special, uh, polymers that --n402575 have the ability to, uh, make certain actinide elements adhere to them.
177109:29	###i don't think anybody around here would understand all the, all those exotic techniques, you know, getting rid --n4023ba of the heavy metals.###.###.###and the thing that --n402502 just was in the local news bulletin was, somebody has, uh, ter-, made some special, uh, polymers that --n402575 have the ability to, uh, make certain actinide elements adhere to them.###.###.###uh, uh, they've, uh, looked at, uh, plutonium and uranium and, uh, some other similar things --n4027d0 to try --n4027df to remove those from radio active waste###.###huh.###.	###actually i've been involved --n402b86 in recycling for long before it became fashionable.###.###we-,
177114:38	###.###uh, uh, they've, uh, looked at, uh, plutonium and uranium and, uh, some other similar things --n4027d0 to try --n4027df to remove those from radio active waste###.###huh.###.###and, again, this is driven --n402940 by all of the documentation and, uh, e s and h, uh, uh, considerations that, uh, people are, uh, worrying about --n4029bf, i think, much more than they should.###actually i've been involved --n402b86 in recycling for long before it became fashionable.###.###we-,###.	###and, uh, in fact i think i was the first person in our department --n402dec to have my thesis published --n402e07 on recyclable pa-, recycled paper.###.###huh.
177205:54	###.### and so, so i got a real problem in that regard.###uh, it,###do,###you obviously are, are not an exercise buff###or else you'd be out there --n402776 doing it.###.###yeah.###i mean, i do it, i guess --n402834,###i'm going --n4028c3 to do it, uh, because i want --n4028ee to get in shape.	###i mean once i get into it and i, if i, if i get into better shape then it'll be, it won't be as much of a, a chore to me.###.###well, it's, it's always a chore.
177233:37	###i got too much weight on right now.###i need --n40341e to lose fifty pounds, you know.###.###right.###.###i need --n4034d6 to lose at least twenty, you know.###but, uh, you know, it's, it's just, uh, i'm busy.###i'm doing a lot of traveling###and, uh, it, it creates a problem, uh, you know, when you're on the road --n403758.### what sort of, uh, uh, what other programs other than say running.	###.###yeah,###i have.
177299:71	###.###yeah.###it's something,###i think, uh, i'm young,###i should get started --n40523a getting into shape.###i don't want --n4052be to,###i want,###i mean at one point it's going --n405370 to be too late to do it. mumblex.###.###well, no.	###.###.###and you can recover.
177350:23	###.### that's, uh, that's a kind of low risk sort of project, isn't it i guess.###.###yeah.###that's a good way to get started --n400c23 --n400c2a.###.###uh, i have a, a, uh, really nice desk. a nicer desk than i could afford. which i got --n400d1e because my sister who --n400d35 worked in a hospital, uh liberated it after a fire###.###uh-huh.###.	###and it turned out --n400fce to be really nice, uh, a nice desk.###maple top i think or or something of that sort.###.
177427:52	### my br-, my brother's used it a lot for making drawers.###i don't know,###.###the big,###.### what, what's your opinion of wha-, what a good router is like --n4027cd --n4027d4.###you know i,###.###uh, i guess it,###.	###they've plastic parts and stuff.###.###the ones that what.
